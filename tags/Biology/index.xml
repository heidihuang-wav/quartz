Summary Distinct circuits for short and long timescale control Sequential negative feedback signals from the mouth and gut engage distinct circuits in the caudal brainstem, controlling feedback behavior on both short (PRLH) and long (GCG) timescales PRLH neurons respond to oral cues and control short-term feeding dynamics PRLH neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) exhibit sustained activation by visceral feedback during stomach nutrient infusion During oral consumption, PRLH neurons shift to a phasic activity pattern linked to the taste of food Optogenetic manipulations show that PRLH neurons regulate the duration of seconds-timescale feeding bursts GCG neurons respond to GI feedback for long-term satiety GCG neurons in the cNTS are activated by mechanical feedback from the gut and track the cumulative amount of food consumed.</description></item></channel></rss>
