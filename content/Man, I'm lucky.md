- For being in the Bay Area, being at UC Berkeley, getting to work with and learn from people I look up to and [meet more of them](https://innovativegenomics.org/inside-igi-health/) in person! (a;lskdjfal;ksdjf ðŸ¤¯)
- For cool conference swag

- For cool people, as curious as they are kind, who aren't afraid to [reach out](https://heidihuang.netlify.app/contact) :) 
### 2022-10-18
- For getting the chance to attend TechCrunch Disrupt! My first exposure to TC Disrupt was through Silicon Valley (the HBO Show, Jared is awesome) in high school. Used to think it was a fictional event lol.
- For getting that sweet deal on the [DDJ-400](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/product/controller/ddj-400/gold/overview/) after it'd been discontinued + speakers from Camila.
- For having a really kind Uber driver (Korean-American man from Arizona). We talked about the NBA (The Redeem Team documentary on Netflix), growing up as an Asian person in a predominantly white area in the 70s, barbecue places, his daughters, and more. Thank you, John, for making the drive from Camila's place in Sausalito back to Berkeley memorable.
