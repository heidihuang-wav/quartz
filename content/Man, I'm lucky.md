Moments I've felt really lucky :) 
### 2024-08-14
- For being in the Bay Area (again). I've met many interesting people, [energetic aliens](https://stephenmalina.com/post/2021-07-01-energetic-aliens-among-us/), and some of my "heroes" (i.e. people whose writing/work I find fascinating and that I've been following for a while)â€”these three categories often overlapâ€”just by being a bus ride away from SF + putting myself out there (i.e. attending events and reaching out to folks).
	- I can't believe I might be leaving in less than a year ðŸ¥²
- I love this city, its energy, and the people it attracts. And how, despite taking their work very seriously, people often don't take themselves as seriously. 
- Of course, I also love the weather, diverse food choices (at least compared to where I lived before), and access to nature.
### 2023-09-28
- For being in the Bay Area (see PG's [Cities and Ambition](https://paulgraham.com/cities.html)), being at UC Berkeley, getting to work with and learn from people I look up to and [meet more of them](https://innovativegenomics.org/inside-igi-health/) in person! (a;lskdjfal;ksdjf ðŸ¤¯)
- For cool conference swag lol
### 2023-09-21
- For cool people, as curious as they are kind, who aren't afraid to [reach out](https://heidihuang.com/contact) :) 
	- I realized showcasing and documenting my thoughts and what I'm doing is just as important as getting out there and doing things, so I [[Journal/2023/Birth of this Microblog|started writing]] on this website in July 2023 to [[Journal/2023/Serendipity, file management|increase my surface area for serendipity]]. Thank you, JT, for being the first person to check out my writing and reaching out to meet up.
### 2023-09-05 
- For California's *accessible* natural beauty (hike @ Lower Fire Trails, right next to campus). Went in between classes on a Tuesday afternoon.<br>

### 2022-10-18
- For getting the chance to attend TechCrunch Disrupt! My first exposure to TC Disrupt was through Silicon Valley (the HBO Show. Jared is the best character) in high school. Used to think TC Disrupt was a fictional event. ðŸ˜…
- For getting that sweet deal on the [DDJ-400](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/product/controller/ddj-400/gold/overview/) after it'd been discontinued + speakers from Camila.
- For having a really kind Uber driver (Korean-American man from Arizona). We talked about the NBA (The Redeem Team documentary on Netflix), growing up as an Asian person in a predominantly white area in the 70s, barbecue places, his daughters, and more. Thank you, John, for making the drive from Camila's place in Sausalito back to Berkeley memorable.
