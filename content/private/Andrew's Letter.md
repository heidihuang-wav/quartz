Dear future Andrew, 

These are the 4 most important aspects of life that I gathered from podcasts, books, world masters, mentors, friends, family, and most importantly my own windy path of trial and errors. 

My hypothesis is that these concepts will remain extremely relevant in the next 2-3 decades and maybe even the entirety of my time or humanity’s time here on Earth. 

What I hope to achieve here is to note down and explain these principles in the most concise, simple yet actionable way possible, and serve as a momento of how 20 year old Andrew thinks abt the world and how to navigate it, hopefully these ideas has stuck in your mind and they’ve become second nature to you.  

Wellbeing = mental wellbeing * physical wellbeing * life mission 
Physical wellbeing = exercise * sleep * food 
Mental wellbeing = relationship with self * relationship with others 
Life mission = self mastery * group mastery 
Relationship with self = equanimity + savoring + expressing & reflecting 
Relationship with others = chemistry + communication * action 


1. Physical well-being  
Exercise, sleep and food are the most important of all, they make and break anything you do. 

Exercise at least 5 times a week, 3 weight training, 2 cardio related, play sports often they’re fun. 

Sleep 8 hours a day for at least 5 days a week. Wake and sleep around the same time every day. Be sure to follow the 3 8-hour phases each day (24hr) to optimize for best deep sleep. 

- first phase: cold shower, meditate, sunlight, walk, then deep work and coffee (80m after wake) 
- second phase: hands on work, creative work, nsdr, workout, sunset light in eyes 
- third phase: socialize, dim lights, limit technology, write and reflect 

Food: try to eat a diverse array of food to gain all the nutrients necessary. 

Eat quick and easy breakfast like fruits or cereal. 

Eat a good and sufficient amount for lunch. Try to avoid food comma by not eating too much carbs and be with friends in the afternoon. 
Prep own dinner if possible and focus on protein and vegetables. 

Limit sweet beverages as much as possible. Limit high sugar always. Track food intake if necessary. 

Other habits: brush teeth and skin routine. 

Developing habits: track 6 habits, intentionally finish 4-5 each day. Organize them by phase of day, use commitment devices like credibility partners, associate your identity with the habit. Make cues easily discoverable and rewards variable. 

2. Mental well-being (self) 

a) Experience (Equanimity) 
Equanimity is about experiencing reality as is. It is the core idea of meditation and is the art of observing and potentially shifting your mind and its thoughts. Being present is too important in this noisy world, don’t think too much about the past, don’t worry over the future. Be present while doing tasks, consuming anything, interacting with others. 

Limit distracting behavior: social media content. Train your brain to focus and be present for long periods of time. 

Equanimity tells us to be present and don’t judge, don’t judge yourself, your mind, things that happen to you, what people do, circumstances you’re in. It is the inner peace that meditation cultivates that drives the best wellbeing, prevents anxiety from taking the reins, and best demonstrates your best human emotions (the positive and the negative). 

Do this by meditating, optimizing dopamine levels (don’t add multiple layers of dopamine inducing activities together, limit high dopamine hits), doing the physiological sigh (inhaling two deep breaths and exhaling through mouth) 

b) Savor
The reason why being present is so important is because research shows that being present makes people enjoy the task even more. 
Some savoring exercises include “the same old same new”, creating and discovering things that are part of our everyday routine but are always neglected. 

Focus on experiences rather then material things. Focus on internal goals rather than external/achievement goals, the previous is the real thing whereas the latter is just a representation of what others believe is real. It keeps us in check of where we’re at in reality. 

c) Express and reflect 
Gratitude is a tricky thing. It appears that expressing and receiving gratitude is a much stronger catalyst than gratitude journals. Express gratitude even just for our sake. 

Reflecting is about learning and improving. One trap we fall into is thinking of our lives as stories. Though appealing, refrain from doing so too often. Reflect not to make a good story, but reflect to know who you are, what you want to do, and what you say day to day. Figure out your style and not give a damn about what others think about it! 

And well, because of how our pleasure/pain seesaw works, the end goals seems to be achieving the 3:1 ratio of positive to negative experiences. The negative shape the foundation of the positive. The valleys shape the peaks. 

3. Relationships
I believe dearly in the concept of Dunbar numbers and how the 5 closest people affect you dearly and the other way around. Which goes to say the importance of good relationships. 

Good relationships comes from three aspects: who you are, how you communicate, and how you act. 

Who you are: this is how you live, what you value, what your experiences are. And of course these same things of the other party. A similar set of values seem to be beneficial, whereas a complementary skillset or personality seems to be beneficial. Nothing is set in stones here but this aspect determine how you interact with each other, what conversations you have, what you do together sometimes. Finding someone with the best chemistry fit and someone who is willing to grow in terms of communication and action is the key. 

How you communicate: 
Nonviolent communication is the key. This means decoupling emotions from needs. The first half to a good relationship is the communication of needs. We often complicate things by adding in emotions like feeling sad, lonely, anxious and so on, but the best way to solve these is to communicate what needs are unmet to your friends and family and vice versa. 

A human need is entirely coming from oneself. ie. Need for feeling important, feeling supported, feeling relaxed at home, feeling secure… 

The second half is communicating how others can help but not force them to. The most impactful help is willingful help. And of course empathy and putting yourself in their shoes is at the center of good communication. 

Other forms of good communication habits include the 3As, never shy away from apologizing, acknowledging and appreciating. You spread positivity into the world, it often comes back to you in one way or another. 

How you act: 
Be consistent rather than focus on big gestures. Although big gestures can sometimes be life changing, it’s more about the consistent love languages that do best. Knowing what others value and finding a balance between their needs and your actions is crucial. All in all, it seems that the trust of having each others‘ backs is the result of good action. 

4. Life mission 
What to master 
- find what interests you 
Discover your ikigai from what you differentiate from others. Your strengths and weaknesses. What is play for you but work for others? What best pushes you into deep focus mode? Dive deep into your origins and neglect the noise from society and family. 

This is a long long process that sometimes never ends, however having a clearer lens of how the world works, how humans behave definitely helps, that’s why I think reading is super important for this as well. 

- find what the world needs 
The world values code and media, creating and selling, technology and psychology, leverage (things that work for you when you’re asleep) and specific knowledge, management and leading, collaboration in big groups and telling compelling stories. 

Find your perfect niche and your specific knowledge, find the leverage (tech, media, equity or any other way to consolidate groups) that makes your heart sing. Those are the skills you should develop. 

How to master 
Focus on the 10,000 hours. Neglect distractions. Different stages of mastery from Robert Greene (still reading): 

Apprentice: observe. Don’t chase praise, achievements or the shiny things. Observe the environment, how people act, where power comes from, how people gain impact. Find mentors and an environment that enables learning over earning even if that means doing low level tasks sometimes. 

Creative-active: practice, practice, practice. Be as hands-on and proactive as possible. You don’t learn how to drive by watching, you learn by bumping into ramps. Find the perfect ratio of input and output. There’s no easy way, don’t be a cook that follows recipes, be a chef that works with first principles. Unlearn our habit of finding the path of least resistance to accomplish tasks, focus on objectives instead. Innovate with the first principles you have. Find the best ratio of open ended and structured work to allow for serendipity while being productive. 

Master: we achieve this stage after 10,000 hours. But keep innovating, stay hungry and foolish, remain humble and have the courage to become a novice again and again in different verticals and different positions. 
—— 
Well, that’s a wrap! In sum, the good life = mental wellbeing (relationship with self * relationship with others) * physical wellbeing * life mission 

Andrew from the future, I just hope you remember these and apply them to the best of your abilities. It’s like the elephant rider metaphor, the rider (my logical side) knows all of this information, but the elephant (my actual self and decision making mechanism) doesn’t fully follow the rider’s instructions. 

Knowing is only one-tenth of the way. Planning is another. Habits, commitment devices, daily actions make up the rest.
