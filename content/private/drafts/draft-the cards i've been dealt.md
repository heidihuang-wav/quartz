title: the cards I've been dealt
subtitle: on resilience.

Dear friends, 
If my life was a deck of cards, each card representing a distinct experience, I have a pretty good hand. I feel incredibly lucky (link to man im lucky page) - to have you all, to be in the Bay Area, and to have the amazing opportunity to learn from people I look up to at the Innovative Genomics Institute. 

At the same time, I also have some pretty shitty cards, most of which represent something I don't feel comfortable writing about in public (yet) and consist of experiences that have left me feeling trapped, suffocated, and doubted. Formative experiences woven deep into my fabric of existence.

To undo these not-so-great cards I've been dealt, I've learned the art of reshuffling my deck. 

I had a self-help book phase. 

Sometimes I wonder if diving head first into work is just a way for me to ignore having to confront the aftermath of those shitty cards. 


Poker metaphor - take a gamble
Breaking out of my cage comes with consequences, though. But as I've gotten older and understood the costs of my actions, I've decided I'd rather have a go at it and deal with the ugly, ugly consequences than not live at all. 

Dealing with the consequences gets easier, or so I thought. But they accumulate, and can be a lot to take in sometimes.

I had a self-help book phase, and I have a self-defined purpose I work toward. I have fulfilling hobbies. My deck now holds cards filled with fulfilling hobbies, the ability to find the silver lining in life's moments, and the practice of living with intention and meaning.

Poker metaphor - life is a series of bets and raises. 
- a bit cliche
Life is a series of bets, raises, and sometimes even bluffs. In my game of poker, I learned to adapt, strategize, and find the inner strength to stay in the game. 

I realized how good/bad the hand I held didn't matter as much as how I chose to play it.
If no one was going to bet on me, I would bet on myself.

After years of trying to build a new hand, a lot more of the cards in my deck are from my own choosing. Not what I started out with.
- Strategies that have helped include introspection. 

Still, 
Sometimes unpredictable things happen, and it feels like I'm back at the beginning again. Back again with that shitty deck I started out with.
I can feel the lingering weight of these tough cards / my starting tough cards. 
I ask, "why me? Why do I have to deal with this?" 
In my late night messages I send, teary-eyed, to V, trembling voice in audio messages to T, and frantic texts to E asking for help and advice - that feeling of desperation, of hopelessness. Feels like I'm back to square 1. 

But, the game's not over. I know it won't be over until I stop trying.

Since high school, 
I've been on a journey to build a new hand, a hand filled with confidence, aspiration, and hope. I've come to accept that I can't control my hand down to every card - i can't control everything in life - and that's okay. Life will always be filled with randomness and uncertainty.
The art of building a new hand, a hand of confidence, aspiration, and hope. 

I can't control everything. So be it. There will always be randomness and uncertainty.

I won't go so far as to say I'm happy I had shitty cards to begin with. I'm not. At the same time, every one has starts out with _some_ shitty cards, they just take different forms.
For what it's worthy, they make me appreciate the hand I now have. 


Coming to college has helped (new environment).

I write not in self-pity but in an attempt to acknowledge - the first step in forgiving and forgetting. 


I'm writing in such broad strokes and in a metaphor about this because I don't wish to disclose the subject matter in public (yet), but I'm more than happy to talk about anything and everything in personal conversations.
