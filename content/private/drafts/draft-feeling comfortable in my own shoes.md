Savor.

> Know thyself.
> —Socrates

I want to be honest with myself with what I'm good at. 

I won't know the meaning of it all, or the purpose of our existence. What I can do is to follow my gut. Fall into opportunities. Experiment. Through trial and error, and reflecting on experiences, I'll learn who I am, what motivates me, where my aptitudes lie, and gain greater self-awareness.

I do everything I do because I can. Because knowledge is beautiful. Because the world is fascinating. Because I love what I do. Not everything needs a well-thought-out purpose statement, especially when you're just starting out.

I like storytelling, so I write and learn how to build websites.

I like music, so I learn how to produce music and DJ.

I like learning about how life works, so I study biology and do research.

instead of obsessing over finding a “why,” spending time on philosophical arguments with no right or wrong, do what makes your heart sing.

I don’t have anything to prove. The fact that I get to exist is enough.

I allow who I am. And that doesn’t conflict with trying to be a better person. Because doing more is not the only way to be a “better” person.

I’m confident in my curiosity and where it’ll lead me.

"study broadly and without fear"

Title: “oh, the choices you’ll make”

How do you know if you’re doing the _right_ thing?

One of the rarest and most rewarding feelings is knowing I’ve chosen to do something that feels undeniably right.

This applies to a simple choice, like stopping by the Memorial Glade on my way home to soak in the sun. Same applies to more major choices, but there are more factors to consider there, and it’s easy to overthink things when making those choices.

I’ve found solace in embracing the simplicity of doing things I love—because they make me happy.

Growth doesn’t always have to be quantifiable; it can simply manifest in the expansion of our experiences, the deepening of our passions, and the connections we forge along the way.

I’m confident in my curiosity and where it’ll lead me.

I trust that I know what _right_ feels like.

A warmth that radiates from within.

Ease / effortlessness (you’re just irresistibly drawn in).

Openness. like standing atop a hill in all its sun-kissed splendor, with a panoramic view stretching as far as the eye can see.

In a world driven by goals, achievements, and the incessant pursuit of meaning, it’s no wonder that the question “why” has become an unrelenting companion in our lives. From college applications to the daunting process of med school admissions, we’ve been taught to dissect our every move, to analyze our motivations with a fine-toothed comb. And while having a strong sense of purpose can undoubtedly propel us forward, there comes a time when this relentless questioning might not be as necessary as we’ve been led to believe.

Sure, having a clear “why” can be the ticket to unlocking our potential and achieving greatness. It can be the driving force that gets us out of bed in the morning, pushing us to overcome obstacles and reach new heights. But what if we allowed ourselves to do things simply because we can? What if we acknowledged that some pursuits are driven not by a grandiose purpose, but by the sheer joy of existence?

I’ve come to realize that not every endeavor requires an elaborate purpose statement. Sometimes, the very act of doing something is reason enough. The world is a vast, intricate tapestry of knowledge and experiences, each thread interwoven with the next. And in the grand scheme of things, isn’t that reason enough to engage with life’s offerings?

I’ve found solace in embracing the simplicity of doing things I love, for the sake of loving them. My passions have become the guiding lights that lead me through the labyrinth of existence. I’m drawn to storytelling, so I immerse myself in writing and the art of crafting narratives. The allure of music has me exploring the realms of music production and DJing, allowing me to express myself in ways beyond words. And my fascination with the intricacies of life itself fuels my studies in biology and my forays into research.

Rather than getting caught in the quagmire of dissecting the “why,” I’ve found liberation in allowing my heart’s desires to take the lead. Instead of engaging in philosophical battles that often yield no definitive answers, I’ve chosen to follow the path that resonates with my soul.

The notion of needing to prove something has gradually lost its hold on me. The very fact that I’m here, existing in this vast universe, is a profound accomplishment in itself. It’s a reminder that I don’t need to attach grand justifications to every action. I can bask in the joy of being alive, allowing my existence to be its own testament.

Embracing who I am doesn’t clash with my desire to become a better version of myself. Growth doesn’t always have to be quantifiable; it can simply manifest in the expansion of our experiences, the deepening of our passions, and the connections we forge along the way.

In my journey, I’ve learned to trust my curiosity, to follow the threads of interest wherever they may lead. I’ve relinquished the need for rigid purpose and instead found solace in the fluidity of my passions. The pursuit of happiness, knowledge, and joy doesn’t always require a meticulously crafted “why.” Sometimes, it’s enough to revel in the present moment, to let our hearts sing the melodies of life without demanding an explanation.

So, let’s challenge the notion that every action must have a profound reason behind it. Let’s allow ourselves the freedom to engage with life in ways that light up our souls. After all, in the grand tapestry of existence, our uniqueness and our pursuit of happiness are reasons enough. And as we navigate this intricate journey, let’s do so with open hearts, trusting that our passions will guide us to places we never imagined possible.
