## Draft 1.0 
Two years ago, I moved from Taiwan to the San Francisco Bay Area - a tech hub full of ambitious, future-oriented dreamers - for college. The towering skyscrapers and fast-paced life in the Bay Area sometimes make me feel energized and excited for what's to come and, yet, other times, I feel lost and confused about my direction in life. Hell, if I had a dime for every time I wished to take a sneak peak at what 40-year-old Heidi's life is like, I'd probably be able to afford the rent around here.

I'm half-way through my third year at UC Berkeley, and many of my friends and classmates are thinking about "the next step" - what to do after college - and I'm no exception. The brutal job search, med school and grad school applications - these things seemed so far away on my first day of college, but they're front and center now. Things are moving so fast, I wish I could hit pause on life sometimes.

We're often told our 20s is an exciting time to be alive: it offers a unique blend of relatively low responsibility and so much choice it can be confusing and almost paralyzing. There's a lot of pressure to "make the right choices" in this pivotal decade because these choices could have a lasting impact on our lives. 

Where should I live? 
Who should I date? 
What field should I study and work in? 
And, of course, the classic existential crisis question ~~surfaces~~: What is my purpose, and what should I do with my life?

I want to go all-out on and work on something I'm passionate about, but how do I decide what that thing/problem I want to dedicate my life's work to is? I have many interests, ranging from molecular biology to music production to web development, so what should I pick in the end? 

I won't be able to re-do/relive my 20s (I won't get back lost time), I try to live intentionally, asking myself why I want to pursue medicine, why I'm involved in Women in Weightlifting, and why I'm starting to learn how to play the guitar on my own now. 

A side effect of trying to live intentionally is a tendency to overanalyze things. But, rather than spend too much time paralyzed by overthinking. I've accepted, for now, that maybe I'll only be able to connect the dots looking backward.
Hopefully, I'll have gained more clarity then. But, for now, no one will be able to answer my questions, and that's okay. For now, I'll let my values guide me. For now, I'll follow my gut, fall into opportunities, and experiment. Through trial and error, and reflecting on experiences, I'll learn who I am, what motivates me, where my aptitudes lie, and gain greater self-awareness.

## Bare bones 
I sometimes still can't believe I'm in my 20s already. Despite the passing years, the sensation of being lost, reminiscent of my teenage years, still lingers. I feel excited for the future but anxious about the uncertainty of it all. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where so many people are ambitious, full of dreams, future-oriented. I moved to the Bay from Taiwan just a few years ago, and it's funny how the towering skyscrapers and the fast-paced life in the Bay Area can make me feel both on top of the world and utterly lost. The excitement of the unknown future is real, but so is the lingering sense of confusion that refuses to let go. If I had a dime for every time I wished for a roadmap for life, I'd probably be able to afford the rent around here.

I'm half-way through my third year in college, and many of my friends and classmates are thinking about "the next step" - what to do after graduating from college - and I'm no exception. The brutal job search, med school and grad school applications - these things seemed so far away on my first day of college, but they're top of mind now. Things are moving so fast, I wish I could hit pause on life sometimes.

Our 20s an exciting time to be alive: it offers a unique blend of relatively low responsibility and so much choice it can be confusing and almost paralyzing. There's a lot of pressure to "make the right choices" in life because these choices could have a lasting impact on our lives when we're older. Where to live? Who to date? What field to study and work in? 

And, of course, the classic existential crisis question surfaces: What is my purpose, and what should I do with my life? I want to do great work, to go all-in on something I'm passionate about for work, but how do I decide what that thing/problem I want to dedicate my life's work to is? I have many interests, ranging from molecular biology to music production to web development, so what should I pick in the end? 

So many questions, but no answers. If you're reading this and are also in your 20s, do you feel the same way? 

To address some of the confusion, and keeping in mind I won't be able to re-do/relive my 20s (I won't get back lost time), I try to live intentionally, asking myself why I want to pursue medicine, why I'm involved in Women in Weightlifting, and why I'm starting to learn how to play the guitar on my own now. ~~Sometimes, the answer requires brainstorming ideas and editing drafts upon drafts for a medical school personal statement, yet, other times, the answer can be as simple as "because I love doing the thing."~~

A side effect of trying to live intentionally is a tendency to overanalyze things. But, rather than spend too much time paralyzed by overthinking. I've accepted, for now, that maybe I'll only be able to connect the dots looking backward.

One day, I'll look back on my time as a college student in the Bay: the hotpot and board game nights with SC, SY, and more, games of pickup basketball with friendly strangers, conversations about life I've had with TF staying up until sunrise, the frantic texts I sent while teary-eyed to EP and VW during one of my lowest moments in 2023. 

Hopefully, I'll have gained more clarity then. But, for now, no one will be able to answer my questions, and that's okay. For now, I'll let my values guide me. What I can do is to follow my gut. Fall into opportunities. Experiment. Through trial and error, and reflecting on experiences, I'll learn who I am, what motivates me, where my aptitudes lie, and gain greater self-awareness.

I do everything I do because I can. Because knowledge is beautiful. Because the world is fascinating. Because I love what I do.

I hope my growth can manifest in the expansion of my experiences, the deepening of my passions and knowledge, and the connections I forge with people along the way.

I trust that I know what _right_ feels like: an internal warmth, an ease that draws me in, and an openness akin to standing atop a hill in all its sun-kissed splendor, with a panoramic view stretching as far as the eye can see. 

I’m confident in my curiosity and where it’ll lead me.

> Know thyself.
> —Socrates

I want to be honest with myself with what I'm good at. 

I won't know the meaning of it all, or the purpose of our existence. What I can do is to follow my gut. Fall into opportunities. Experiment. Through trial and error, and reflecting on experiences, I'll learn who I am, what motivates me, where my aptitudes lie, and gain greater self-awareness.

I do everything I do because I can. Because knowledge is beautiful. Because the world is fascinating. Because I love what I do. Not everything needs a well-thought-out purpose statement, especially when you're just starting out.

I like storytelling, so I write and learn how to build websites.

I like music, so I learn how to produce music and DJ.

I like learning about how life works, so I study biology and do research.

instead of obsessing over finding a “why,” spending time on philosophical arguments with no right or wrong, do what makes your heart sing.

I don’t have anything to prove. The fact that I get to exist is enough.

I allow who I am. And that doesn’t conflict with trying to be a better person. Because doing more is not the only way to be a “better” person.

I’m confident in my curiosity and where it’ll lead me.

### To keep

"study broadly and without fear"

How do you know if you’re doing the _right_ thing?

One of the rarest and most rewarding feelings is knowing I’ve chosen to do something that feels undeniably right.

This applies to a simple choice, like stopping by the Memorial Glade on my way home to soak in the sun. Same applies to more major choices, but there are more factors to consider there, and it’s easy to overthink things when making those choices.

I’ve found solace in embracing the simplicity of doing things I love—because they make me happy.

Growth doesn’t always have to be quantifiable; it can simply manifest in the expansion of our experiences, the deepening of our passions, and the connections we forge along the way.

I’m confident in my curiosity and where it’ll lead me.

I trust that I know what _right_ feels like.

A warmth that radiates from within.

Ease / effortlessness (you’re just irresistibly drawn in).

Openness. like standing atop a hill in all its sun-kissed splendor, with a panoramic view stretching as far as the eye can see.

In a world driven by goals, achievements, and the incessant pursuit of meaning, it’s no wonder that the question “why” has become an unrelenting companion in our lives. From college applications to the daunting process of med school admissions, we’ve been taught to dissect our every move, to analyze our motivations with a fine-toothed comb. And while having a strong sense of purpose can undoubtedly propel us forward, there comes a time when this relentless questioning might not be as necessary as we’ve been led to believe.

Sure, having a clear “why” can be the ticket to unlocking our potential and achieving greatness. It can be the driving force that gets us out of bed in the morning, pushing us to overcome obstacles and reach new heights. But what if we allowed ourselves to do things simply because we can? What if we acknowledged that some pursuits are driven not by a grandiose purpose, but by the sheer joy of existence?

I’ve come to realize that not every endeavor requires an elaborate purpose statement. Sometimes, the very act of doing something is reason enough. The world is a vast, intricate tapestry of knowledge and experiences, each thread interwoven with the next. And in the grand scheme of things, isn’t that reason enough to engage with life’s offerings?

I’ve found solace in embracing the simplicity of doing things I love, for the sake of loving them. My passions have become the guiding lights that lead me through the labyrinth of existence. I’m drawn to storytelling, so I immerse myself in writing and the art of crafting narratives. The allure of music has me exploring the realms of music production and DJing, allowing me to express myself in ways beyond words. And my fascination with the intricacies of life itself fuels my studies in biology and my forays into research.

Rather than getting caught in the quagmire of dissecting the “why,” I’ve found liberation in allowing my heart’s desires to take the lead. Instead of engaging in philosophical battles that often yield no definitive answers, I’ve chosen to follow the path that resonates with my soul.

The notion of needing to prove something has gradually lost its hold on me. The very fact that I’m here, existing in this vast universe, is a profound accomplishment in itself. It’s a reminder that I don’t need to attach grand justifications to every action. I can bask in the joy of being alive, allowing my existence to be its own testament.

Embracing who I am doesn’t clash with my desire to become a better version of myself. Growth doesn’t always have to be quantifiable; it can simply manifest in the expansion of our experiences, the deepening of our passions, and the connections we forge along the way.

In my journey, I’ve learned to trust my curiosity, to follow the threads of interest wherever they may lead. I’ve relinquished the need for rigid purpose and instead found solace in the fluidity of my passions. The pursuit of happiness, knowledge, and joy doesn’t always require a meticulously crafted “why.” Sometimes, it’s enough to revel in the present moment, to let our hearts sing the melodies of life without demanding an explanation.

So, let’s challenge the notion that every action must have a profound reason behind it. Let’s allow ourselves the freedom to engage with life in ways that light up our souls. After all, in the grand tapestry of existence, our uniqueness and our pursuit of happiness are reasons enough. And as we navigate this intricate journey, let’s do so with open hearts, trusting that our passions will guide us to places we never imagined possible.
