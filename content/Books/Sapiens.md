# Notes

## Part 1: The Cognitive Revolution

-   _Homo sapiens_ is Latin for "wise man"

-   early _Homo sapiens_ existed at the same time as at least six other human species, including:
    
    -   _Homo floresiensis_ - small with a max height of ~3 ft
    -   _Homo denisova_ - native to Siberia, discovered in 2010
    -   _Homo neanderthalensis_ - aka Neanderthals
    -   _Homo rudolfensis_ - lived in East Africa
    -   _Homo erectus_ - oldest known early humans to have had modern human-like body proportions
    -   _Homo sapiens_ - that's us!

### How come _Homo sapiens_ is the only surviving species of the Homo genus?

There are 2 conflicting theories that attempt to answer this question.

1.  The **Interbreeding Theory**: _Homo sapiens_ began mating with the other _Homo_ species, leading to hybridization and an eventual merging of the two species.
    
    -   Supporting evidence: Modern Europeans' DNA contains around 1-4% of Neanderthal DNA and DNA from other archaic human species.
    -   Counterargument: Mating between individuals of different species does not usually result in viable, fertile offspring. [Postzygotic barriers](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book%3A_General_Biology_(Boundless)/18%3A_Evolution_and_the_Origin_of_Species/18.02%3A_Formation_of_New_Species/18.2B%3A_Reproductive_Isolation?ref=heidi-huang.ghost.io#:~:text=Postzygotic%20barriers%20include%20the%20creation,produce%20offspring%20(%20hybrid%20sterility%20).) such as hybrid inviability and hybrid sterility typically lead to hybrid individuals being less fit than their purebred parents.
    
2.  The **Replacement Theory**: _Homo sapiens_, possessing superior survival abilities and technology, drove the other human species to extinction by outcompeting them for resources and/or by slaughtering them.

So, which theory is it?

The debate is ongoing, but the extinction of all other members of the _Homo_ genus could have been the result of a mixture of both interbreeding and replacing other species.

### The Cognitive Revolution and Development of Complex Language

The "cognitive revolution" was triggered by forces unknown ~70,000 to 30,000 years ago when the brains of _Homo sapiens_ underwent a significant mutation, akin to consuming the biblical fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil.

While we don't know the cognitive revolution's exact causes for now, we do know that its most significant result is giving us the ability to use **complex language**.

![](https://media.tenor.com/u-0QUbw3pTgAAAAC/communication-spongebob.gif)

SpongeBob gets it.

The development of intricate language systems gave rise to the capacity for abstract thinking, symbolic representation, and complex social interactions.

Complex language enabled _Homo sapiens_ to communicate and share ideas more effectively, facilitating collaboration, innovation, and the transmission of knowledge across generations.

### How Complex Language Catalyzed _Homo sapiens'_ Global Conquest

Language helps unite group members so we can...

1.  cooperate in **large numbers** (e.g. empires with millions of people) and
2.  work together **dynamically**, adapting to changes in the environment and responding to cues as they come

Complex language enables the creation and discussion of [common myths](https://www.ynharari.com/topic/power-and-imagination/?ref=heidi-huang.ghost.io), which enable us to work toward common goals.

Examples of common myths include:

-   💰 Money: money has no intrinsic value but functions as a medium of exchange and a store of value based on a shared belief system. It represents a mutual agreement among individuals within a society.
-   ⛪️ Church: The concept of a church, or any religious institution, is a collective myth as it represents a shared belief in the existence of higher powers or deities. It encompasses religious rituals, practices, and traditions that are upheld and followed by believers within a particular religious community.
-   🇭🇺 Hungary, the country: Like any nation-state, Hungary is a collective myth—a human-created concept that defines a geographical territory and its associated political and cultural identity. It encompasses shared historical narratives, symbols, languages, and governance structures that unite individuals under a common identity as "Hungarians."

"Let me stop you right there. Humans aren't the only organisms who communicate via language."  
Yep, you're totally right. There's even a whole Wikipedia page on [animal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_language?ref=heidi-huang.ghost.io).

But human language is distinct from animal language. Here are some qualities human language possesses that animal language doesn't:

1.  Complexity
2.  Flexibility
3.  Abstraction: the expression of abstract concepts, ideas, and thoughts detached from immediate sensory experiences. Animals primarily communicate about concrete and immediate matters, such as food, predators, or mating signals.
4.  Displacement: the ability to discuss events or objects not present in the immediate context or timeframe. Animals typically communicate about things that are happening in their immediate surroundings.
5.  Productivity: human language is highly generative, allowing for the creation and comprehension of an infinite number of novel expressions and ideas
6.  Metalinguistic Awareness

While this linguistics detour has been fun, let's refocus.

As human language developed, common myths were spread, and the size of our communities—groups of people believing in collective myths working toward the same goal—grew from villages to cities to nations to empires, one of which spanned across virtually every timezone, to today's interconnected world.

## Part 2: The Agricultural Revolution

### Sowing the Future: The Transition from Humans' Hunter-Gatherer to Agricultural Lifestyle and the Resulting Exponential Population Growth

![](https://media.tenor.com/sH_KNNF07EoAAAAC/honest-word-its-honest-work.gif)

For most of history, _Homo sapiens_ have been hunter-gatherers.

Hunter-gatherers live in small, mobile communities and rely on hunting, fishing, and gathering wild plants for sustenance. This means early _Homo sapiens_ led a nomadic lifestyle, moving in search of food sources and following seasonal patterns.

~12,000 years ago, the **Agricultural Revolution** hit, marking the time when _Homo sapiens_ started growing crops and domesticating animals, giving up their nomadic lifestyle and settling into agriculture.

Two factors drove this transition into an agricultural lifestyle:

1.  **Gradual Societal Shift**: The shift to agriculture unfolded slowly and progressively, deeply ingraining itself within societies over successive generations. By the time the disadvantages of farming became evident, it had become too deeply rooted to easily reverse course.
2.  **Increased Food Production**: Agriculture offered a notable advantage by providing a significantly higher food yield per unit of land. Through cultivating crops in concentrated areas, farmers were able to generate a surplus of edible plants, leading to a substantial increase in the overall food supply.

This surplus enabled human societies to support larger populations, leading to a rapid expansion of the _Homo sapiens_ population.

🚜 While the author calls The Agricultural Revolution "history's biggest fraud" and views foraging as a superior lifestyle to farming, I disagree. Skip to [[Books/Sapiens#my thoughts|my thoughts]] to find out why.

However, it also resulted in worsened living conditions for individuals. And what do we do with all these people?

## Part 3: The Unification of Humankind

### Trade Created the Need for Money and Writing

Before the Agricultural Revolution, communities operated on a **system of mutual favors**, where individuals could rely on their neighbors for support. However, with the advent of agriculture, this gave way to a more efficient **barter system**.

Agriculture allowed people to produce enough food for their communities, freeing them from the constant pursuit of their next meal. This surplus enabled the development of specialized trades, such as blacksmithing and weaving. People would trade their goods, like knives or shovels, with farmers who needed them in exchange for food.

However, as trade expanded, the limitations of the barter system became evident. It became increasingly difficult to find someone who wanted your goods and had what you needed in return. Trust became an issue.

In response, ~3,000 BC, _Homo sapiens_ developed writing and money.

The Sumerians of Mesopotamia pioneered this development. They started recording complex trades on clay tablets in a script called Cuneiform, using symbols to represent transactions.

![](https://heidi-huang.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/4849.webp)

Cuneiform, the oldest form of writing in the world 👆

They also introduced barley money as a standardized form of payment. This allowed individuals to pay a shoemaker, for example, with a currency that could be easily converted into whatever else the shoemaker needed.

Transactions could also be recorded, ensuring that promises made could be held accountable in the future.

### The Growth of Empires and Religion

As societies and economies grew, they became more complex and challenging to manage. In response, human societies developed laws and systems of authority to regulate behavior and maintain order.

This led to the emergence of hierarchical societies, with a king or emperor at the top.

While past monarchies and empires may be viewed as authoritarian, they provided **stability** in various aspects of life and established effective bureaucracies that standardized laws and customs.

For example, in 1776 BC, Babylon, the world's largest empire at the time, was governed by King Hammurabi, who issued the Code of Hammurabi. This code ensured a shared understanding of permissible behavior, covering areas such as theft, murder, and taxation. People within the empire knew which laws to follow, fostering uniformity and order.

Enforcing laws required the acceptance of authority, and **religion** played a vital role in legitimizing imperial rule.

King Hammurabi, for instance, claimed a divine appointment to rule over the citizens of Mesopotamia, aligning his authority with religious beliefs. The belief in divine selection strengthened people's acceptance of imperial rule.

The spread of empires also led to the promotion and expansion of religions, often through assimilation or coercion, as diverse ethnic and religious groups were brought under the umbrella of a few dominant cultures.

## Part 4: The Scientific Revolution

### Science enabled new discoveries, technologies, imperialism, and European economic growth

In the 16th and 17th centuries, a scientific revolution sparked a transformation in human society. Rather than relying solely on divine intervention, people began harnessing science to improve their lives.

![](https://heidi-huang.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/lossy-page1-1200px-Galileo_Galilei_-1564-1642-_RMG_BHC2700.tiff.jpg)

Galileo Galilei, a central figure of the Scientific Revolution

Through exploration, experimentation, and observation, significant advancements were made in fields like medicine, astronomy, and physics, leading to a better society.

European governments recognized the economic benefits of scientific advancements. Kings and emperors realized that to conquer and control vast territories, they needed scientific data on geography, cultures, languages, climate, flora, fauna, and histories of new lands.

Thus, they generously funded scientists and explorers, seeking new ideas and resources to enrich their nations. Christopher Columbus's voyage across the Atlantic epitomized the value of the scientific method.

![](https://heidi-huang.ghost.io/content/images/2023/07/2560px-Viajes_de_colon_en.svg.png)

Columbus' various voyages

Exploration and scientific innovation propelled European economies forward. Imperial expansion resulted in the destruction of indigenous cultures while connecting previously isolated worlds, establishing global empires and trade networks.

### The Global Legacy of European Empires: Capitalism and Consumer Culture

Throughout history, European empires used the scientific method to expand their territories and increase their wealth.

By the nineteenth century, the British Empire spanned a significant portion of the globe, spreading European ideas and norms to diverse cultures. One enduring legacy of this imperial influence is the widespread belief in ✨ capitalism ✨.

Capitalism has become a central aspect of global society. Regardless of nationality or background, most individuals center their lives around money and believe in the power and importance of money and material possessions.

The rise of science has also challenged religious beliefs, leading to a shift in focus from the afterlife to earthly pleasures. Many traditional religious principles have been undermined by scientific discoveries, while capitalist ideology emphasizes the pursuit of happiness in the present moment, pushing individuals onto a path of hedonism.

The power and reach of global capitalism have had a profound impact on cultures worldwide, overshadowing traditional beliefs and customs. As European empires have waned, their cultural inheritance, particularly the emphasis on capitalism, continues to shape our modern world.

### And They Lived Happily Ever After: Globalization and the Pursuit of Peace

While globalization faces criticism for potentially eroding cultural diversity, it offers a significant advantage: it contributes to a more peaceful world. In the interconnected global economy, nations rely on each other for prosperity, creating incentives for leaders to prioritize peace.

Indeed, as Harvard professor [Steven Pinker](http://stevenpinker.com/?ref=heidi-huang.ghost.io) states:

> "Violence has been in decline over long stretches of time...we may be living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence." ([source](https://www.edge.org/conversation/mc2011-history-violence-pinker?ref=heidi-huang.ghost.io))

Since 1945, recognized independent nations have avoided conquest and elimination by others, marking the most peaceful century in history. In contrast, violence was rampant before the end of World War II. This shift towards peace can be traced back to the development of hierarchical societies after the Agricultural Revolution, which enforced laws against murder and violence, fostering stable and functional societies.

It is estimated that, during the time of hunter-gatherers, a staggering 30% of adult males fell victim to murder or manslaughter. In contrast, today's world sees only one percent of adult male deaths resulting from violence. This significant decline exemplifies the progress made in reducing violence throughout human history.

However, maintaining peace requires vigilance. Although we live in relatively peaceful times, the potential for large-scale international conflicts demands our attention. The consequences of such conflicts in today's interconnected world would be unprecedented.

Therefore, while we enjoy the peace we have achieved, it is essential to actively work towards its preservation.

### So, Why Does Life Still Suck? The Pursuit of Happiness: Individual vs. Societal Perspectives

While our health, wealth, and knowledge have greatly improved over time, the question remains: do _we_ feel happier?

Studies using subjective well-being questionnaires reveal that our **long-term happiness** tends to remain relatively **stable**. Although we experience temporary fluctuations in happiness or sadness, the overall level of happiness typically returns to a baseline.

Even significant events, like losing a job or experiencing a historical revolution, may initially impact our happiness, but we eventually settle back into our usual state.

On an individual level, _Homo sapiens_ dwell in a delicate balance between contentment and despair. This equilibrium prevents us from being overwhelmed by traumatic events while maintaining our drive to seek greater accomplishments and aspirations.

On a societal level, though, the picture of happiness becomes more complex:

-   While advancements in quality of life have brought prosperity, it has disproportionately benefited a privileged few.
-   Marginalized groups, including indigenous tribes, women, and people of color, have long been victims of imperialism and capitalism, only recently beginning to make strides toward equality.

### What's Next for _Homo sapiens_? Bionics, Anti-Aging, and the Quest for Immortality

Scientists are at the forefront of groundbreaking research in fields like bionics and anti-aging, offering glimpses into a potential future that challenges our very definition of humanity.

![](https://media.tenor.com/lQdeBJdCGegAAAAC/patrick-stewart-cyborg.gif)

cyborgs, y'all

In the realm of bionics, the fusion of human and machine, scientists have achieved remarkable feats. Through cutting-edge technology, individuals like Jesse Sullivan, who lost both arms, have been equipped with bionic limbs that can be controlled by their thoughts alone.

Advancements in anti-aging research are equally promising. Scientists have made significant strides in extending the lifespan of organisms such as worms and mice through genetic modifications.

Legal and ethical considerations currently restrict the full exploration of these fields. Yet, the allure of immortality and the relentless drive of humanity may eventually transcend these barriers.

In the not-so-distant future, it is conceivable that our species, _Homo sapiens_, will undergo profound transformations through scientific advancements, blurring the lines between organic and machine.

Perhaps, we stand on the brink of becoming a new species, embodying a synthesis of human ingenuity and technological enhancement.

# my thoughts

As someone who isn't a history buff, _Sapiens_ has given me a framework with which to think about the complexities of humanity and the evolution of modern civilizations, building a foundation for further exploration and expansion.

However, critics ([here](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/11/sapiens-brief-history-humankind-yuval-noah-harari-review?ref=heidi-huang.ghost.io) and [here](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2022/07/the-dangerous-populist-science-of-yuval-noah-harari?ref=heidi-huang.ghost.io)) have raised concerns about Harari's inclusion of [erroneous details](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/11/sapiens-brief-history-humankind-yuval-noah-harari-review?ref=heidi-huang.ghost.io#:~:text=Starting%20from%20the,on%20Navarino.), sensationalism, and portrayal of speculative ideas as established facts in his work, particularly when discussing prehistoric events or the cognitive abilities of early humans.

While this criticism doesn't dismiss the stimulating ideas put forth in Harari's work, it highlights the necessity of upholding accuracy and discerning between well-established evidence and speculative theories when delving into intricate and multifaceted subjects.

For this reason, I'm usually not a huge fan of "a brief history of everything" (in this case, a brief history of humankind) type books because attempting to cover vast amounts of information in fewer than 500 pages will likely lead to oversimplification and sweeping statements derived from superficial, or worse, straight-up wrong, accounts of historical events.

🚜 I'm also skeptical of Harrari's argument that agriculture is "the biggest fraud in history" and that foraging is a better lifestyle than farming for humans.

The shift to agriculture brought about a significant shift in human existence. It freed our ancestors from the constant struggle to secure food and allowed them to develop more complex social structures and engage in activities beyond subsistence.

With agriculture, humans gained the ability to cultivate crops and domesticate animals, paving the way for greater stability, specialization of labor, and the rise of civilizations. 🚜

That being said, _Sapiens_ is a book I'd still recommend to any _Homo sapiens_ out there looking to understand the historical forces that have shaped our world and gain a broader perspective on human civilization and its complexities.

The book also raises some interesting questions about the future of humanity as technologies like genetic engineering and AI keep maturing, inviting readers to contemplate the potential paths that lie ahead for our species.
