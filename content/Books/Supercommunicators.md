## Figure out what the conversation is *really* about
There are 3 types of conversations
1. Practical 
	- Be in a decision-making mindset
	- Solve problems together
2. Emotional 
	- "How do you feel?"
	- Tell stories, show empathy
3. Social 
	- "Who are we?"
	- Is about social dynamics, how we perceive ourselves and others

>Do you want to be helped (practical), hugged (emotional), or heard (social)? 
## Ask open-ended questions to understand others' *feelings*
Instead of asking, "Where did you grow up?" ask, "What was your favorite thing about where you grew up?"

Ask open-ended questions that invite people to share their feelings and experiences. This approach helps us learn about their needs, goals, beliefs, values, and emotions.

Aligns with [[My Values, Beliefs, & Questions]] - be curious, ask lots of questions and follow-up questions. This also shows that you're listening.
## Vulnerability goes both ways
> There is a cycle: Asking deep questions about feelings, values, beliefs, and experiences creates vulnerability. That vulnerability triggers emotional contagion. And that, in turn, helps us connect.

## Pay attention to others' moods and energies
And try to match them. Synchronizing with others' tones, moods, and energies helps with successful communication.

Duhigg cites an interesting [study](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/562z7) by Sievers et al. on the neural synchronization that happens during consensus-building conversation to make the above point.
