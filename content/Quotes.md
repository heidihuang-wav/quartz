## Gottfried Ephraim Lessing
> If God were to hold all Truth concealed in his right hand, and in his left only the steady and diligent drive for Truth, albeit with the proviso that I would always and forever err in the process, and to offer me the choice, I would with all humility take the left hand.

## 徐志摩 
> 得知，我幸；不得，我命

## Sam Altman
> Have almost too much self-belief

## Young Sheldon
> Rabbi Schneiderman: Sheldon, when your days are over, God will never ask you, 'Why weren't you Einstein?' But he might ask you, 'Why weren't you Sheldon?'

## How love should be / 出自安妮寶貝的《薔薇島嶼》
> 最好的愛情是兩個人彼此做伴。不要束縛，不要纏繞，不要佔有，不要渴望從對方身上挖掘到意義，那是註定要落空的。而應該是，我們兩個人，並排站在一起，看看這個落寞的人間。我愛你，不是因為你隨時隨地都能陪我，也不是你看起來像我的影子，你是你，我是我，我們兩個人是不同的兩個個體，我們珍惜在一起的每一個時刻，也尊重每一分冷暖自知的獨立狀態。

## *Flow* by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
> "Attention can be invested in innumerable ways, ways that can make life either rich or miserable."

> “This sense of humility—the recognition that one’s goals may have to be subordinated to a greater entity, and that to succeed one may have to play by a different set of rules from what one would prefer—is a hallmark of strong people”

> “It is one thing to recognize that life is, by itself, meaningless. It is another thing entirely to accept this resignation. The first fact does not entail the second any more than the fact that we lack wings prevents us from flying”
