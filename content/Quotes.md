Young Sheldon quote about being yourself
> Rabbi Schneiderman : Sheldon, when your days are over, God will never ask you, 'Why weren't you Einstein?' But he might ask you, 'Why weren't you Sheldon?'

A quote about how love should be / 安妮寶貝的《薔薇島嶼》說過一段話
> 最好的愛情是兩個人彼此做伴。不要束縛，不要纏繞，不要佔有，不要渴望從對方身上挖掘到意義，那是註定要落空的。而應該是，我們兩個人，並排站在一起，看看這個落寞的人間。我愛你，不是因為你隨時隨地都能陪我，也不是你看起來像我的影子，你是你，我是我，我們兩個人是不同的兩個個體，我們珍惜在一起的每一個時刻，也尊重每一分冷暖自知的獨立狀態。

> "Attention can be invested in innumerable ways, ways that can make life either rich or miserable."

- We choose how we respond to stimuli.

> “This sense of humility—the recognition that one’s goals may have to be subordinated to a greater entity, and that to succeed one may have to play by a different set of rules from what one would prefer—is a hallmark of strong people”

- Sometimes, you just gotta do what you gotta do. 🤷‍♂️

> “It is one thing to recognize that life is, by itself, meaningless. It is another thing entirely to accept this resignation. The first fact does not entail the second any more than the fact that we lack wings prevents us from flying”

- If ya don’t like something, change it. Or at least _try_ to change it.

> Purpose, resolution, and harmony unify life and give it meaning.

- Think, act, achieve.
