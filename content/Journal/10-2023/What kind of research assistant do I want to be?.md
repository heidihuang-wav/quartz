I will...
1. Show up on time + consistently. Be reliable.
3. Take thorough notes. Be like Patrick.

4. Ask questions if I don't understand anything! 
5. Try to understand *why* things are being done.
6. Read cool papers. Ask for recommendations.
7. I will make mistakes. Own up to them and learn from them. Try not to make the same mistake twice.
8. Have fun.
