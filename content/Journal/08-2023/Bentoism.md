### What is Bentoism? 
> [see for yourself!](https://bentoism.org/)
- A multi-dimensional way of framing what you want 
	- x-axis is time: from now -> the future
	- y-axis interest: from self interest -> collective interest
- A tool for making decisions aligned with our values and goals. 

### My Bento

### What does each quadrant mean? 
Directly taken from [here](https://bentoism.org/2-the-bento-method#18)
1. **Now Me**: is the most “selfish” part of you. The part that craves safety, pleasure, and autonomy.
2. **Future Me**: is the older, wiser version of yourself that lived up to their commitments and made all the right decisions. What do they say matters most in life for you?
3. **Now Us**: are the people we rely on and who rely on us. Our families, neighbors, coworkers, people of the same faith, ethnicity, nationality, and so on.
4. **Future Us**: are the next generations.

### How I'll be using my bento
When I have tough "should I" questions that need a closer look.
> Should I take this new opportunity? 

> Should I confront X person? 

I'm not sure how my bento will evolve, or if I'll even deem it useful in the future, but, at this moment, I like the idea of:
1. taking into account not only my interests, but also those of my future self, loved ones, and future generations
2. having a tool to aid my decision-making and remind me of what matters on a greater scale of time and level of individualism vs. collectivism

### Other Thoughts
- Reminds me of the book "What We Owe the Future" by William MacAskill
