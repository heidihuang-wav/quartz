The opposite of Patrick Collison's [Fast](https://patrickcollison.com/fast). 

Significant projects and discoveries that took 20 years or more to complete. Why did they take so long? If things were done differently, could we have sped up the process? 

1. Darwin's theory of natural selection (20 years from conception to publication)
	Probably would've taken even longer to publish if Alfred Russell Wallace
2. The Human Genome Project
3. Higgs boson discovery
4. Discovery and proof of quasicrystals (30 years)

5. Global eradication of smallpox
