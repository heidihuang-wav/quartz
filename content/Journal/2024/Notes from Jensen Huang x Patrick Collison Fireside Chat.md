Jensen Huang (黃仁勳,  NVIDIA President) was a guest speaker at Stripe Sessions 2024. Here are some notes I took during Jensen's hour-long conversation with Patrick Collison. 

- Jensen has 60 direct reports - removes layers of hierarchy in company 
- No privileged access to info - empowers people 
	- Everyone operates on the same information
	- No one-on-one meetings: feedback given in front of everyone, so everyone can learn from others' experiences
- Jensen encourages his employees to develop products for "zero billion dollar markets" - products that might not yet have customers/markets today
- Words over spreadsheets - explain your reasoning
- On running a business - “if you’re not engaging AI aggressively you’re doing it wrong. You’re not going to lose your job to AI, you’re going to lose your job to another person who uses AI”
- Use words like "craft and beauty" (Patrick) and "love and care" (Jensen) if you want them to reflect in your company's culture and products
	- These are ineffable characteristics that customers may not have the words to request, can't be put in product specs, but that can be experienced by the customer when they use your products
- Simplicity is not simple
