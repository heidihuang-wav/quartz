## Personal Projects
A [[Journal/07-2023/Birth of this Microblog#Recent Observation|recent observation]] of the kinds of personal projects I pursue has prompted me to ask myself this question:
> If I had an infinite amount of money and time, would I still be doing what I'm doing? Would my professional pursuits be the same? 

I hesitated before answering yes to this question, which alarmed me. After thinking about this, I recognize the reason for my hesitation is my impatience. 
- The alternative: software, tech startups.
- The question: so, why not software?
	- My primary interest lies in healthcare and the life sciences. This has been true for as long as I can remember.  

> [!faq]- Revision: ~~I also know there is exactly a ***0% chance*** I will be exceptional in the area if I go for software.~~
> 
> I will never let my self-perceived chances at being "exceptional" at something stop me from pursuing it because, to me, that goal seems a bit too black-and-white. I thought more about this statement after it was challenged. Instead of thinking about things this way, potentially perpetuating negative self-fulfilling prophecies, I'll just focus on doing the [[Journal/07-2023/Focus & Hell Yeah or No|"hell yeahs"]], the things that are exciting and worth pursuing to me. Whether I have a shot at being "exceptional" at it or not is secondaryâ€”I'll let the world decide that for me and allow outcomes, whatever they are, to unfold naturally.

> Thank you, TF, for challenging this notion.

> ðŸ›‘ I've dedicated considerable thought to my purpose and motivations ("why"), whether the field I've chosen is right for me ("what"), and other questions about the essence of my work. Given that I feel pretty solid about my answers to those questions for now, it's time to stop doing that for a little bit. For the next year or two, I believe it'll be more productive to direct my time and energy towards doing that work, rather than pondering and writing extensively about its nature.


- The bottom line: I want to help build something to help people. Ideally, to help improve health outcomes.
- Source of my frustration: biotech seems to be much more regulated and slow-moving compared to software/tech startups
- What I want to do: biotech
- What I'm on the path to doing (and what matters most at the end of the day): biotech 
	- cool, what I want to do and what I'm on the path to doing align. that's all i need to know.

> don't lose sight of what really drives you. it's easy to be distracted by shiny things that seem to promise fast(er) results.
