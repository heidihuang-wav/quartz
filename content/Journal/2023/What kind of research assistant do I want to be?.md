I will...
1. Show up on time. Be consistent and reliable.
2. Take ownership of my work. Be proactive and think about how my job fits into bigger pictures (e.g. the lab's long-term goals, my journey, etc.).
3. Take thorough notes. Be like Patrick.

4. Ask questions if I don't understand something. 
5. Understand *why* things are being done. Context ðŸ“ˆ. 
6. Read cool papers. Ask for recommendations.
7. I will make mistakes. Own up to them and learn from them. Try not to make the same mistake twice.
8. Have fun.
