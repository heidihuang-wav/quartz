- Have confidence in your curiosity and where it will take you. 
- Say no. Set boundaries. Every true "no" is a "yes" to your true self. 
- The right person makes things 100x easier. 
- Intimacy requires vulnerability. 
- Dunbar's Number: we can really only have 150 relationships – of, on average, 5 intimate friends, 15 good friends, 50 friends, and 150 acquaintances (all-encompassing). Emotional intensity shrinks at each rung, and the first rung is where I put 80% of time and intention toward.
- "If you’re evenly split on a difficult decision, take the path more painful in the short term." —Naval Ravikant
- Consistency is key.
- Healing takes time. 
- Cherish your deep connections; they are not easy to come by. 
- You don't have to have your stuff figured out. You likely won't for the rest of your life, and that's fine :)
