Howdy, Heidi here. Welcome to my **notebook**: the place for my scattered thoughts and updates. 

*Pro-tip*: if you're on desktop and can't see the Table of Contents/Explorer on the left on the home page and the Graph View on the right, ==zoom out== on your browser until you can.

If you'd like to say hi and/or meet up, the best way to reach me is through this [contact form](https://heidihuang.com/contact). You can find the contact form at the bottom of every page, accessible through the hyperlink labeled 'Let's Chat!'
