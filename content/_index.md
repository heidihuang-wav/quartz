Welcome to my **thought log**: the place for all my scattered notes and updates. *Pro-tip*: if you can't see the Table of Contents/Explorer on the left on the home page and the Graph View on the right, zoom out on your browser until you can.

If you'd like to say hi and/or meet up, the best way to reach me is through this [contact form](https://heidihuang.netlify.app/contact). You can find contact form at the bottom of every page, accessible through the hyperlink labeled 'Let's Chat!'
