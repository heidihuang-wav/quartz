An attempt to record everything I know about fitness.

## Weightlifting
### Tips
- If you can, train "harder than last time" - Greg Doucette. Not every workout you'll be able to add weight or feel at your best, but push yourself in the gym. 
- Rest days are necessary. Taking no rest days is not going to give you better results.
### My approach
I aim to get stronger with progressive overload. I don't have a quantifiable goal (hit X weight on Y lift in Z months) because I find it gives me unnecessary pressure. I don't specialize in powerlifting, bodybuilding, or calisthenics. I don't do bulking / cutting cycles because I want my physique to stay more-or-less the same year-round. Maingaining is the way to go.
### Resources
- Jay Cutler - top exercises for each body part ([short video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XEWeyt5nyoY))
- Training frequency

## Diet / Nutrition
### Tips
- Calories in, Calories Out (CICO). 
- Focus on adding to your diet rather than subtracting (e.g. On a time crunch and/or budget? It's okay to eat frozen food. How can you add fiber, protein, etc. to it? )
- Calorie-tracking works for some, but can easily turn into an obsessive thing. Macro-tracking is exhausting but perhaps worth it to try once.
### Tracking your nutrition
#### My approach
#### Calorie tracking apps
- MyFitnessPal 
- LoseIt
- MacroFactor - not free, though
### Cutting
Good resource to use: https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/bb90l0/most_accurate_bmrtdee_calculator/ 
- Calculate your BMR using an online BMR calculator
- Calculate your TDEE using the Harrison-Benedict equation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u4tpODih2s - Will Tennyson's video)
- For weight loss: eat 300-500 cal fewer than your TDEE
### Bulking

## Cardio
### General tips
Make cardio fun for *you*. There is a lot of room to do introduce variety to your cardio workouts: swimming, biking, hiking, playing basketball, dancing, etc.

If you look hard enough, there will be an activity you enjoy. Find what it is and do it. 

Aim to do at least 120 min of cardio a week.
### My approach
- I love playing basketball and hiking. 
- I have a jump rope (cheap, accessible, you can jump rope anywhere).

## Conclusion
Sustainable fitness (something you'll keep doing for the rest of your life) is about finding a diet and exercises that work for *you* - your schedule, your likes and dislikes, your life.

Are there days in which I feel lazy and slack off? Absolutely. 
Sometimes, traveling, the holidays, or whatever throw you off for a bit.
You're not going to lose all your gains because you stopped working out for a few weeks.
As long as you don't let it become a habit (useful tip: Matt d'Avella's 2 day rule), you're good.
