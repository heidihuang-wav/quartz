After three years of college, Berkeley feels like home to me.

As a third-year, I know when the gym is the most crowded, what to expect during the first few weeks of each semester, and which study strategies work best for me for different types of classes.

Junior year has been the most transformative year yet, bringing the most personal and academic growth.
  
Here are some key takeaways and reflections from my third year.
### Follow your curiosity. Don't be afraid to cut bullshit out of your life.
At the beginning of Fall semester of junior year, I was enrolled in an upper-division public health course, but I quickly realized the Public Health major wasn’t the right fit for me. I *did* enjoy some classes, such as [Public Health 150D: Introduction to Health Policy and Management](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/pbhlth-150d) and [Public Health 142: Intro to Biostatistics](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2023-fall-pbhlth-142-001-lec-001), but the rest of the major requirements did not interest me. I felt the opportunity cost of staying in the rest of those classes for the sake of completing the major just so I could have "Public Health BA" on my diploma was too high. 

A conversation with a friend who majored in public health and later pivoted to Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) further encouraged me to drop the major. During office hours, a public health professor had explained to him that many universities don’t offer undergraduate public health programs because public health is a lens through which to apply foundational knowledge gained in fields like chemistry, infectious disease, or political science—knowledge that is typically built during undergrad—with public health pursued at the graduate level.

I decided to drop the public health major and commit my time to MCB in the fall of my third year. ==Instead of pursuing breadth, I wanted to focus on depth==. Around the same time, I had also just joined the Wilson Lab. After reading Walter Isaacson’s *[[Reading List |The Code Breaker]]* the summer before, I became fascinated by CRISPR. I reached out to Prof. Wilson (aka Ross), whose lab focuses on CRISPR delivery, to ask about joining as an undergrad researcher. To my excitement, Ross responded, and I couldn't wait to start learning all about biochemistry and genome editing from the very people I had just read about in Issacson's book.
### Research
I was determined to make the Wilson Lab a priority. I would try to attend most lab meetings, get to know everyone in lab, ask questions, and read relevant papers. 

After a year in the Wilson Lab, ==I’ve found translational research incredibly rewarding==. My coursework in biochemistry and genetics has reinforced this. Now, in my fourth year, I’m taking classes in drug delivery, experimental methods, and therapeutics discovery and development. These classes all together, and I’ve never been more excited about my classes.

The more I learn in class, the better I understand my research, which in turn helps me understand what I learn in class better—a true virtuous cycle.

#### Independent Project
I wanted to have more responsibility and autonomy, so I pushed myself to pursue an independent project. In a conversation with another friend, I learned that it's important to ==advocate for yourself==. Don't be afraid to ask for things (within reason, of course).

I used the pressure of the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) application deadline to make sure I would come up with a written plan for my project. I  was fortunate enough to be selected as a SURF fellow. Presenting for the first time ever at a lab meeting over the summer was nerve-wracking, given I was the only undergrad at the meeting, and this was also my first time ever presenting at any lab meeting. 

In the end, the presentation went well, and I received useful feedback (e.g. how to make my graphs clearer and how to adjust color schemes for color-blind accessibility). I’m continuing to build on my SURF project and plan to turn it into my senior thesis.

My time in the Wilson Lab has solidified my desire to pursue an MD-PhD. I feel incredibly supported here, and I hope to make the most of the time I have left here.
### Taking the MCAT

While I was doing summer research, I was studying for the MCAT. Yep, the MCAT: the big scary 7.5-hour test people take to get into medical school.

Juggling research, MCAT prep, and other responsibilities was challenging, pushing my physical and mental stamina to their limits at times. 

Looking back, despite the stress, the studying process gave me a boost of confidence heading into my fourth-year classes. I didn’t have the strongest foundation in organic chemistry, but I used MCAT prep as an opportunity to review and relearn key concepts. I also focused on biology and biochemistry topics that I had previously glossed over in class, like the immune system and fatty acid synthesis.

As I write this, I don’t know my score yet, but I find comfort in knowing that the preparation itself was valuable.
### Personal Growth
I'm grateful I said "yes" to a wide range of experiences during my first and second years—from 5 am dragon boating at the Berkeley Marina to frat parties—because now I have a better understanding of myself and what I enjoy.

- I've learned that I enjoy one-on-one conversations and smaller group gatherings where I can get to know people through conversations over larger gatherings. 
- I've learned that it's okay to try hard and care a lot. 
- I've learned that, whether playing sports, board games, or video games with friends, I love being around people who inspire me and make me excited about everything the world has to offer.

As I've learned more about my preferences, I’ve also embraced self-acceptance, letting go of concerns about how others perceive my likes and dislikes. I’m more comfortable with who I am. 

Though I’m still not the best at texting (sorry to my friends who are reading this!), I hope to focus on maintaining and nurturing meaningful relationships. Because, ultimately, ==it’s the people who make Berkeley feel like home.==

On growing into myself: I had a conversation with [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/), who said people don’t change much, they just become more themselves—and I think I agree.
### Physical Health
#### Lifting
- Ever since I [[Yearly/2022 Initial Goal Setting|started lifting]], I've stayed really consistent with it, even throughout the three months I spent in Taiwan.
- I'm proud of this consistency, since I used to quit things halfway through a lot growing up
#### Running
- I used to hate running. In my junior year, I ran my first ever race in my life (a 5k) and ran the longest distance I've ever run so far (15K).

- More races to come next year!
