Learnings from 2022 goal-setting.

I was inspired to start this whole annual goal-setting thing because of [[Book List|Atomic Habits]].

1. Picking 2 goals to focus on is too much. For this year, I can only say with 100% confidence that I hit the "making exercise a consistent habit" goal, but I can't say I successfully hit the "read a book every month" goal.
	- ==For next year, only set 1 goal. ==
2. ==Small but consistent changes compound over time into something big and meaningful==.

Favorite quotes from [[Book List|Atomic Habits]] by James Clear:
> Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. 

> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

> Good habits make time your ally, bad habits make time your enemy.
