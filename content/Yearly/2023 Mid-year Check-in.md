According to my [[Reading List]], I've read ten books as I'm writing this (08.21.2023). I may be on track for now, but during the semester I will have less time to read books. 

I especially enjoyed reading during the summer months and loved having large chunks of time (e.g. on the plane) to. just. read. ðŸ˜Œ 

## Reminder: Why did I choose this goal? 
I wrote this long postâ€”[[Journal/08-2023/Reading is pretty darn cool|Reading is pretty darn cool]]â€”as a reminder of why reading is great and why I chose this goal.
