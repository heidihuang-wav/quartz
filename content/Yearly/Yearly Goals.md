title: "Yearly Goals"
---
Attempting to pick up or amp up a solid habit each year. Think of it as New Year's resolutions, but with an extra dose of organization.
## 2023
> [!todo] To read 12 books in 12 months

## 2022
> [!todo] To consistently (on average 4 days/week) exercise (lifting weights + doing cardio)

2022 was the first year I started setting yearly goals. Originally, all the planning was done on Notion.
