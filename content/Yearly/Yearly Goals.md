Think of it as New Year's resolutions, but with an extra dose of structure.
## 2024
>[!todo] In progress

I've set a goal for myself but will be keeping it private until the end of the year. I've heard mixed things about telling people about your goalsâ€”some say telling people lets those people keep you accountable; others say telling people about your goals prematurely gives you a dopamine spike (i.e. you get a reward without actually having done anything to get closer to your goal). 

I'm not sure what the case is for me, so I'm going to test things out. 
## 2023
> [!check] To read 12 books in 12 months

I started getting back into reading in 2021. Now is a good time to reinforce reading as a habit.

2022 was the first year I started setting yearly goals. Originally, all the planning was done on Notion.
