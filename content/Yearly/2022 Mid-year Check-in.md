## Mid-Year Review (5/22/2022)

### 1. Working Out and/or Spending Time Outdoors 140 min+/week

According to Fitness app (data collected from Apple Watch)
- I did well in Jan, Feb (peak), March (for the most part)
    - start of the year, I had the most momentum
    - worked out consistently
- Fairly well towards the end of March + April
- Not so well in May (finals, summer vacation - no access to gym, though not an excuse)
    - At home, I’ve been playing basketball and jumping rope; definitely spending time in nature but not so much working out w weights

### 2. Reading 1 book/month

So far I’ve read…

- Atomic Habits (Audible)
- Digital Minimalism (Audible)
- The Dip (Audible)

I’m currently reading…

- The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck (Audible)
- The Healing of America (paperback)

Comments

- It’s harder for me to finish paperback books than audiobooks. I just started reading *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck* a few days ago, and I’m already more than halfway through, but I started reading _The Healing of America_ a few weeks ago, and I’m far from being halfway through.
- There’s a higher “activation energy” for reading paperback books.

## Reflection

- So far, so good (surprisingly? lol)
- I need to keep up with goal #1 by spicing things up.
	- From now until 6/21 (I’ll move back to campus and have access to the RSF), I’ll switch things up - do cardio somedays (or every day) and do stuff with my 2 10-lb dumbbells
	- I think I also got bored of cardio cause it got repetitive (basketball and jump rope), so until I can use the RSF again introducing some variety should help.
- Summer classes haven’t begun yet, so keeping up with goal #2 should be fairly easy to do. I’ll just keep doing what I’ve been doing. Once classes start again, with audiobooks, I should still be able to hit my goal. It’ll just be a little more challenging.

## Reminder: Why Did I Choose These Goals?

1. Health. Also spending time outside makes me happy. Most of what I do (work, study, texting/calling, music, shows, etc.) consists of sitting down and being stationary, so it’s important to get moving. As I continue to study physiology, public health, and metabolic diseases, I want my identity to be associated with healthy living, so I should lead by example.
2. To learn stuff outside of school (nonfiction). For fun (fiction). To discover new things and learn about the world. To get into the habit of lifelong learning.
