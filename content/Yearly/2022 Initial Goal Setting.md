## How I plan on establishing this habit:

- Making the cues obvious + reducing the friction needed for me to get movin'
	- Always have my basketball and jump rope lying around where I can _see_ them
	- Make clothes/shoes/socks easily accessible so I can get out of bed and leave my room/apartment/house
- Make it attractive
	- I get to listen to an audiobook or music while exercising
- Make it immediately satisfying
	- Mocha cappuccino flavored protein powder is seriously the best flavor out there y'all
- Other strategies
	- Never bring laptop into bedroom (will decrease chances of me watching Netflix there and just lying/sitting on my bed for long periods doing nothing)

## What is another habit I hope to establish in 2022?
- Reading 1 book a month (or, at least, reading 8 books total in 2022)

## How I plan on establishing this habit:

- Listen to audiobooks!
- Reasons
	- I can listen to books on the go, and I spend a fair amount of time commuting or doing tasks (e.g. washing the dishes, exercising) that don’t require my full attention
	- Paperback books are much more expensive, and I need to set aside dedicated time to read them. I also move around a lot, and physical books can be a hassle to transport. Hence why I’ve been reading a grand total of zeeero books.
	- The biggest advantage of audiobooks is it will make reading much more accessible and convenient, and it is a cheaper alternative to physical books.
	- Audiobooks will aid me on my path to becoming a *reader - someone who regularly reads*
