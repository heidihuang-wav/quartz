I want to read a book every month. That's twelve books in twelve months. 

The number of books is arbitrary, really. I kinda just thought the repetition of twelve gives the name a nice ring. Reading twelve books in a year is not a lofty goal, but it's a realistic goal for my schedule. Things get very hectic during the semester (classes, research, clubs, people, internships), so reading anything more than 1 book / month is unrealistic. 

In my [[Yearly/2022 Initial Goal Setting|2022 Initial Goal Setting]] page, I had planned to read a book a month in 2022, but I couldn't do it. This year, though, I've decided to make establishing reading as a habit my sole focus.

## Reducing Friction
1. Make it obvious
	- I always have my devices near me, so accessing books should be very easy
	- I also brought 2 physical copies of books, so I can switch things up if I'm getting tired of reading from my devices
2.  Make it attractive
	- Explore different genres and topics to keep my reading experiences diverse and engaging
		- I usually read less fiction, so reading more fiction something I could explore
	- I'm curious about the biotech industry and want to learn more, so this is a great opportunity to read up on biotech
	- Talk to friends who also read. Share what you're reading with each other and ask if they have book recommendations, reviews, etc. Make it fun.
3. Make it easy
	- Choose books that match my interests and preferences. It will be a lot easier to want to keep listening if I'm passionate about the subject matter. Besides, I'm not doing this for anyone else, so I have no reason not to.
	- Experiment with different formats, such as audiobooks or e-books, which can be convenient for on-the-go or multitasking situations.
4. Make it immediately satisfying
	- After finishing a book, I'll take a moment to reflect on what I've learned or enjoyed from the reading. This sense of accomplishment can help reinforce the habit.
	- Annotate, take notes, and write long-form blog posts on books (if I want) to make the experience feel more meaningful and satisfying.
