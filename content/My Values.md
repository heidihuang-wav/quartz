I'd like to be...
## Intentional.
Have clarity in your values and self-defined purpose.
## Consistent.
Sustained intention.

Have a high follow-through rate: if you say you're going to do something, *do it.*
## Attentive.
Be generous with your attention on the people and things that matter the most to you.

Be present. Strike up [[Real talk - interesting conversation questions|conversations]] with those around you. Go on walks and check out your surroundings. Be interested in what people have to say. 

Show that you care.
## Creative.
Keep producing music, writing, cooking, and coding. 

Make things. Have fun. 
## Earnest.

Do things for the right reasons and try as hard as you can at doing those things.

## Introspective.
Reflect on what you're doing. Why are you doing what you're doing? 
If you continue down this trajectory, where will you be in X years? Is that where you want to be?
## Open-minded.
If you never mess around, you'll never [find out](https://twitter.com/rogerskaer/status/1576025818182332416). 

Be open to honest feedback and criticism.
## Grateful.
Exude vitality. Never lose that sense of joie de vivre. Remember to *express* your gratitude.
