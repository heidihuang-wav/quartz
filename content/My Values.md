I'd like to be...
## Intentional.
Have clarity in your values and self-defined purpose.
## Consistent.
Sustained intention.

Have a high follow-through rate: if you say you're going to do something, *do it.*
## Attentive.
Be generous with your attention on the people and things that matter the most to you.

Be present. Go on walks and take in the scenery. What looks the same, and what looks different? Listen to what people are saying and notice their emotions, behaviors, and needs.

Show that you care.
## Creative.
Keep producing music, writing, cooking, and coding. 

Make things, have fun. 
## Earnest.

Do things for the right reasons and try as hard as you can at doing those things.

## Introspective.
Reflect on what you're doing. Why are you doing what you're doing? 
If you continue down this trajectory, where will you be in X years? Is that where you want to be?
## Open-minded.
If you never mess around, you'll never find out. 

Be open to honest feedback and criticism.
## Grateful.
Exude vitality. Never lose that sense of joie de vivre. Remember to *express* your gratitude.
