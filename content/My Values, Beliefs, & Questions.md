# My Values
I'd like to be...
### Intentional.
Have clarity in your values and self-defined purpose.
### Consistent.
Sustained intention.

Have a high follow-through rate: if you say you're going to do something, *do it.*
### Attentive.
Be generous with your attention on the people and things that matter the most to you.

Be present. Strike up [[Real talk - interesting conversation questions|conversations]] with those around you. Go on walks and check out your surroundings. Be interested in what people have to say. 

Show that you care.
### Creative.
Keep producing music, writing, cooking, and coding. 

Make things. Have fun. 
### Earnest.

Do things for the right reasons and try as hard as you can at doing those things.

### Introspective.
Reflect on what you're doing. Why are you doing what you're doing? 
If you continue down this trajectory, where will you be in X years? Is that where you want to be?
### Open-minded.
If you never mess around, you'll never [find out](https://twitter.com/rogerskaer/status/1576025818182332416). 

Be open to honest feedback and criticism.
### Grateful.
Exude vitality. Never lose that sense of joie de vivre. Remember to *express* your gratitude.

# My Beliefs
> Strong convictions, loosely held. 

- Is a hot dog a sandwich? No. According to the [Cube Rule of Food Identification](https://cuberule.com/), a hot dog is a taco.
- [School is not enough](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/06/school-is-not-enough/). More meaningful early experiences and opportunities for agency outside conventional schooling paths, please.
- More [walkable and bikable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxykI30fS54) cities, please. 
- Act fast. The benefits of [being impatient](https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/) compound. 
- [Conviction](https://blog.aayushg.com/fake_conviction/) is the scarcest resource, not time.

## Parenting 
I don't have kids. If that ever changes, I might do this with them: 
- The [Hard Thing Rule](https://characterlab.org/character-hub/resources/grit-the-power-of-passion-and-perseverance/) from *Grit* by Angela Duckworth: A **hard thing** is something that requires daily, deliberate practice
	- Purpose: to encourage grit while allowing the child to choose their own path
	1. Everyone in the family does a hard thing (including the parents) 
	2. No quitting the hard thing in the middle (you can quit at a natural stopping point, but no quitting after a bad day)
	3. *You* choose your hard thing based on your interests (no one else chooses it for you)
