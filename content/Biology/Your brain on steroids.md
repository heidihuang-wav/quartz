What do roids do to your brain? Let's find out.

### The Role of Neurotransmitters
- Dopamine: Steroids and PEDs can lead to increased dopamine levels in the brain.
    - Elevated dopamine can induce feelings of euphoria and reward, contributing to enhanced motivation and focus during training and competition.
    - The "dopaminergic reward pathway" may lead to the reinforcing effects of these substances, potentially leading to abuse.
- Serotonin: Prolonged steroid use may decrease serotonin levels.
    - Reduced serotonin is associated with mood swings, aggression, and impaired decision-making, commonly observed in some athletes abusing these substances.
    - The altered serotonin function might contribute to a heightened risk of impulsive and aggressive behaviors.

### The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis
- Steroids and PEDs can disrupt the HPA axis, affecting the body's stress response system.
    - Chronic exposure to these substances may suppress the production of cortisol, leading to an increased risk of injuries as cortisol helps regulate inflammation and immune response.
    - Dysregulation of the HPA axis can also lead to mood disorders and adrenal insufficiency when the body becomes reliant on external steroid sources.

### The Limbic System and Emotions
- The limbic system is responsible for processing emotions and aggression.
    - Steroid use may hyperactivate the amygdala, leading to increased aggression and irritability.
    - The influence of steroids and PEDs on neurotransmitters can lead to significant mood and behavioral changes. Increased aggression and irritability, commonly referred to as "roid rage," may occur due to altered serotonin and GABA receptor activity.

### Cognitive Function and Memory
- Chronic steroid use may affect cognitive function and memory.
    - Some studies suggest that long-term use of steroids may impair working memory, attention, and executive functions.
    - These cognitive deficits could impact an athlete's ability to strategize and make quick decisions during sports events.

### The Reward System and Addiction
- Steroids/PEDs can activate the brain's reward system, leading to potential addiction-like behaviors.
    - Athletes may develop a psychological dependence on these substances due to their performance-enhancing effects and rewarding sensations.
    - Addiction can have severe consequences, leading to adverse health effects and a decline in athletic performance.

### Neuroplasticity and Long-term Changes
- Chronic use of steroids/PEDs can alter brain neuroplasticity.
    - Long-term exposure may lead to changes in neuronal connections and neural networks.
    - These changes may persist even after discontinuing the substances, impacting an athlete's mental and physical health in the long run.
