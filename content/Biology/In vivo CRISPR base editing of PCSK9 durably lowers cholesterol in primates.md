## Summary
1. The paper demonstrates the successful in vivo delivery of CRISPR adenine base editors using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to modify disease-related genes in cynomolgus monkeys (*Macaca fascicularis*).
2. CRISPR base editors efficiently and precisely modified the *PCSK9* gene in the liver, resulting in significant reductions in PCSK9 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. 
3. The reduction in PCSK9 and LDL-C levels remained stable for at least 8 months after a single-dose treatment, supporting the potential for a "once-and-done" approach.
4. The study establishes proof-of-concept for the efficient in vivo delivery of base editors to (non-human) primate livers, a crucial step for developing these editors for human disease treatment. 
5. Base-editing demonstrated advantages over standard gene-editing nucleases in terms of precision, efficiency, and potential for correcting disease-causing single-nucleotide mutations.
## The Paper
### Background 
> what is the gap in knowledge this research is trying to address?

- Gap in knowledge regarding efficient in vivo delivery of CRISPR adenine base editors to nonhuman primates 
	- There are many examples of in vivo editing of target genes using CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases and CRISPR base editors in *rodent models* but not primates
	- Transition from rodent models --> nonhuman primates is critical before considering in vivo administration of gene editors to human patients in clinical trials
- PCSK9 gene is targeted for in vivo gene editing due to its relevance to familial hypercholesterolaemia, and the study aims to explore the potential of a 'once-and-done' approach for reducing LDL-C levels compared to existing therapies.
### Hypothesis
- CRISPR adenine base editors delivered in vivo using LNPs can efficiently and precisely modify disease-related genes, specifically the *PCSK9* gene, in cynomolgus monkeys
### Experiments
1. **Base Editing in Hepatocytes In Vitro:**
    - Identified 20 gRNAs targeting PCSK9 splice sites and selected PCSK9-1 with high editing activity and orthogonality.
    - Formulated LNPs containing ABE8.8 mRNA and PCSK9-1 gRNA for efficient delivery to human and cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes.
    - Achieved over 60% base editing of the PCSK9 splice site in primary human hepatocytes and observed similar editing in cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes.
2. **Base Editing in Mice:**
    - Formulated LNPs containing ABE8.8 mRNA and PCSK9-1m gRNA for intravenous infusion in mice.
    - Observed approximately 70% liver base editing at various doses, indicating saturation editing of hepatocytes.
3. **Base Editing in Cynomolgus Monkeys:**
    - Administered LNPs to cynomolgus monkeys via intravenous infusion at different doses.
    - Observed over 50% mean base editing frequencies in short-term studies, with reductions in PCSK9 and LDL cholesterol.
    - Undertook a long-term study with a higher dose (3.0 mg kgâˆ’1) to assess durability and tolerability.
4. **Assessment of Off-Target Editing:**
    - Used oligonucleotide enrichment and sequencing to evaluate off-target editing in cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes and liver samples.
    - Identified minimal off-target editing at specific sites, demonstrating the precision of base editing.
### Observations and Conclusions
- Adenine base editing provide highly effective in knocking down *PCSK9* gene function in cynomolgus monkeys, achieving > 60% editing
- Reductions in PCSK9 in the blood and LDL-C levels remained stable for at least 8 months, which surpasses the effects of current cholesterol-lowering drugs
- LNPs with base editors showed fewer off target effects compared to AAV-delivered meganucleases in previous studies
### Iteration / Future Directions
- Further evaluation of the *risks* associated with in vivo base editing is needed before advancing to human studies
- Future research should explore the application of base editing to other therapeutic target genes and its use in different organs (in addition to the liver)
## Other Notes
### Things I had to look up
- Concomitant := naturally accompanying
- *PCSK9* gene: provides instructions for making a protein (PCSK9 protein) that helps regulate the amount of cholesterol in the bloodstream ([source](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/pcsk9/))
	- PCSK9 protein: breaks down low-density lipoprotein receptors before they reach the cell surface, so more cholesterol can remain in the bloodstream
- Meganuclease := endonucleases that recognize large DNA target sites ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC156710/))
