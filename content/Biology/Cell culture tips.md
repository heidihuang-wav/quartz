As my postdoc / mentor likes to say, 
> Trust no one. (only applies to cell culture, not to life in general)

## Tips
- Before each use
	- Make sure sash is at the correct height 
	- Wipe down hood thoroughly with booze (70% ethanol) before starting and after each use
- Sterile handling
	- Spray down *everything* that goes into the hood with booze, including 
		- First time putting your hands and arms into the hood: spray your gloved hands + a little bit up your sleeve
		- Every time your hands exit the hood, spray them with booze again before putting them back into the hood
	- Switch Pasteur pipette tips at at least between different cell types
	- Apparently a controversial statement, but keep lids and caps facing up 
	- Avoid sucking up media into serological pipette gun 
	- Keep lids and caps on as often as possible
	- Try your best to not touch the inside of dishes and flasks with pipettes and tips
- Organization
	- Keep objects out of the vent at the front of the hood (push things inside the hood)
	- Try not to pass hands, bottles, pipettes, tubes etc. over any open and uncovered media bottles, uncovered plates, and opened tips
- After each use
	- UV 
	- Wipe everything down with booze
	- Vacuum tube: spray with bleach + booze
