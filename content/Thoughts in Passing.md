For random thoughts that do not warrant standalone pages.

- If anyone has suggestions for a tagging system for all my notes please let me know! The number of notes I have has been steadily growing, so I've been thinking about how to organize all these notes.
- Other than California, where would I want to live post-grad? 
- I'd rather try and fail than to never have tried at all. 
- CMV: junior year is the toughest year of undergrad (disclaimer: I haven't experienced all 4 years of college yet, so I could be totally wrong here) 
- TV shows I want to watch
	- The Wire
- Recent shows I've been watching
	- The Bear: first two seasons are [phenomenal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMGog1cU8BY&t=488s)
	- Bojack Horseman (rewatch)
- I want to reconcile my 2 domains: [heidihuang.xyz](https://heidihuang.xyz) and this one. Maybe get rid of one and get a subdomain instead
