For random thoughts that do not warrant standalone pages.

- I want to come up with a list of questions I can ask myself periodically to orient myself in my personal and professional lives. To think about what I've been up to (because so much happens so fast), reflect on how I feel about my current position, and assess where I want to go next. Something like a quarterly reflection. 
- Other than California, where would I want to live post-grad? 
- I'd rather try and fail than to never have tried at all. 
- CMV: junior year is the toughest year of undergrad (disclaimer: I haven't experienced all 4 years of college yet, so I could be totally wrong here)
