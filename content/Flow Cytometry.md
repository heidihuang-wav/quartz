- Takeaways from video
	- **Flow cytometry** is an experimental technique used to *count and analyze individual cells within a mixed population based on their size, shape, and other properties*.
	- Flow cytometry involves a machine called a flow cytometer, which consists of components like lasers, optics, detectors, and a computer system.
	- When a sample is placed in the flow cytometer, it is mixed with saline solution and passed through a laser beam, with each cell scattering light in multiple directions.
	- Forward scatter measures cell size. Side scatter measures cell shape and complexity. These measurements are converted into voltage pulses and presented as histograms.

	- Flow cytometry can also detect and quantify fluorescent signals from molecules like antibodies or dyes, allowing for the analysis of multiple colors simultaneously, making it a powerful technique for characterizing cell populations.
