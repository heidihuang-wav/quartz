# Weightlifting
## "Best" exercises for every body part
By best, I'm considering potential for progressive overload, amount of tension muscle receives in most stretched position, range of motion, effectiveness (as demonstrated by research), and feel (i.e. subjectively, how smooth does the exercise feel?). 
### Back
- **Lat pulldown** variations
	- **Wide-grip**, **neutral-grip**
	- **Single-arm half-kneeling** 
- **Pull ups**
### Biceps
- **Cable curls** 
	- Provide *constant tension* throughout the movement (whereas dumbbells do not). This means the biceps are under consistent load during both the concentric (lifting) and eccentric (lowering) phases of the exercise. 
	- The nature of the cable machine helps in maintaining a more *controlled movement*, reducing the likelihood of using momentum to lift.
### Chest
- Any kind of **incline press**, dumbbell or barbell: research ([Chaves et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7449336/)) has shown that the incline bench press activates the upper chest more than the horizontal bench press while targeting other parts of the chest just as well as the horizontal bench press
- **Chest press machine**. Better at progressive overload than the incline press. Make sure it gives your chest a good stretch at the starting position. 
### Triceps
- **Dips** (including weighted and assisted dips)
- **Skullcrushers**
### Shoulders
- **Lateral raise machine** 
### Rear Delts
- **Reverse fly (machine)**
### Quads
### Hamstrings
- **Seated hamstring curls** are preferred over lying hamstring curls because your hamstrings are in a stretched position when seated with your legs stretched out but not when you're lying down.
### Glutes
- **Romanian deadlifts**
- **Hip thrusts**
### Other

## Tips
- Progressive overload. Not every workout you'll be able to add weight or feel at your best, but push yourself in the gym. 
- Rest days are necessary. Not taking rest days is not going to give you better results.
## My approach
I aim to get stronger with progressive overload. I don't have a quantifiable goal (hit X weight on Y lift in Z months) because I find it gives me unnecessary pressure. I don't specialize in powerlifting, bodybuilding, or calisthenics. But, if I had to pick a category that I lean most towards, it would be bodybuilding. I maingain and don't do bulking / cutting cycles because I want my physique to stay more-or-less the same year-round.

# Diet / Nutrition
## Tips
- Calories in, Calories Out (CICO). First law of thermodynamics. 
- Focus on adding to your diet rather than subtracting (e.g. On a time crunch and/or budget? It's okay to eat frozen food. How can you add fiber, protein, etc. to it? )
- Calorie-tracking works for some, but can sometimes turn into an obsessive thing. Macro-tracking is exhausting but perhaps worth it to try once. 
	- Argument for calorie-tracking: helps you build an intuition about the caloric content of your meals so that even if you stop doing it down the line, you'll always have a rough sense of how many calories something is
- A simple way to find out how many calories to eat:
	- First, find out what your bodyweight (BW) is *in pounds*
	- Then, to find out how many calories to eat, take your BW and multiply by the following numbers according to your goals (weight gain, maintenance, or weight loss)
	- For extreme weight gain (generally not recommended)
		- BW x 21 
		- BW x 20
		- BW x 19
	- For moderate weight gain
		- BW x 18
		- BW x 17
		- BW x 16
	- Maintenance
		- BW x 15
		- BW x 14
		- BW x 13
	- For moderate weight loss
		- BW x 12
		- BW x 11
		- BW x 10
	- For extreme weight loss (generally not recommended)
		- BW x 9
		- BW x 8 
		- BW x 7
## Tracking your nutrition
### My approach
- I use a spreadsheet to track my daily calorie and protein intake. If you're curious what the spreadsheet looks like and/or would like a copy of it, feel free to [reach out](https://heidihuang.netlify.app/contact)!
- I do not track any of my other macros
### Calorie tracking apps
- MyFitnessPal 
- Cronometer
- MacroFactor - not free, though
### Resources
Resource: https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/bb90l0/most_accurate_bmrtdee_calculator/ 
- Calculate your BMR using an online BMR calculator
- Calculate your TDEE using the Harrison-Benedict equation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u4tpODih2s - Will Tennyson's video)
- For moderate weight loss: eat 300-500 cal fewer than your TDEE
# Cardio
## Tips
Make cardio fun for *you*. There is a lot of room to introduce variety to your cardio workouts: dancing, swimming, biking, hiking, boxing, etc.

If you look hard enough, there will be an activity you enjoy. Find what it is and do it. Find other people who enjoy the same activity and do it together. 

Aim to do at least 120 min of cardio a week.
## My approach
- I love playing basketball and hiking. 
- I have a jump rope (cheap, accessible, you can jump rope anywhere).
- I used to hate running, but I like it now! The best part about running is that you can do it literally anywhere.
# Mindset and Motivation
## On fitness influencers, social media, & celebrities

Don't compare yourself to what you see on screen because you likely don't know the full story behind how XYZ celebrity got to where they are. 
## On being a beginner / trying new things
I used to be terrified of failure. I still haven't completely gotten over being afraid of looking stupid when trying new things. 
But, 
# Conclusion
Get started today. If you are starting from 0, getting started is the most important thing. Don't overthink things or worry about optimizing your workout and diet. As you keep going, you will make adjustments based on how you feel and how things are going. 

**Sustainable** fitness (something you'll keep doing for the rest of your life) is about finding a diet and exercises that work for *you* - your schedule, your likes and dislikes, your life.

Are there days in which I feel lazy and slack off? Absolutely. 
But it's better to be imperfectly consistent than perfectly inconsistent. 
Don't let a couple of failures throw you off.
