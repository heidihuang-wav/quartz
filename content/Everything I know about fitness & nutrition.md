An attempt to record everything I know about fitness.

# Weightlifting
## Best exercises for every body part
By best, I'm considering potential for progressive overload, amount of tension muscle receives in most stretched position, range of motion, effectiveness (as demonstrated by research), and feel (i.e. subjectively, how smooth does the exercise feel?). 
### Back
### Biceps
### Chest
- Any kind of **incline press**, dumbbell or barbell: research ([Chaves et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7449336/)) has shown that the incline bench press activates the upper chest more than the horizontal bench press while targeting other parts of the chest just as well as the horizontal bench press
- **Chest press machine**. Better at progressive overload than the incline press. Make sure it gives your chest a good stretch at the starting position. 
### Triceps
### Shoulders
### Quads
### Hamstrings
### Glutes
### Other

## Tips
- If you can, train "harder than last time" - Greg Doucette. Not every workout you'll be able to add weight or feel at your best, but push yourself in the gym. 
- Rest days are necessary. Not taking rest days is not going to give you better results.
## My approach
I aim to get stronger with progressive overload. I don't have a quantifiable goal (hit X weight on Y lift in Z months) because I find it gives me unnecessary pressure. I don't specialize in powerlifting, bodybuilding, or calisthenics. But if I had to pick a category that I lean most towards, it would be bodybuilding. I maingain and don't do bulking / cutting cycles because I want my physique to stay more-or-less the same year-round.

# Diet / Nutrition
## Tips
- Calories in, Calories Out (CICO). First law of thermodynamics. 
- Focus on adding to your diet rather than subtracting (e.g. On a time crunch and/or budget? It's okay to eat frozen food. How can you add fiber, protein, etc. to it? )
- Calorie-tracking works for some, but can sometimes turn into an obsessive thing. Macro-tracking is exhausting but perhaps worth it to try once. 
	- Argument for calorie-tracking: helps you build an intuition about the caloric content of your meals so that even if you stop doing it down the line, you'll always have a rough sense of how many calories something is
- A simple way to find out how many calories to eat:
	- First, find out what your bodyweight (BW) is *in pounds*
	- Then, to find out how many calories to eat, take your BW and multiply by the following numbers according to your goals (weight gain, maintenance, or weight loss)
	- For extreme weight gain (generally not recommended)
		- BW x 21 
		- BW x 20
		- BW x 19
	- For moderate weight gain
		- BW x 18
		- BW x 17
		- BW x 16
	- Maintenance
		- BW x 15
		- BW x 14
		- BW x 13
	- For moderate weight loss
		- BW x 12
		- BW x 11
		- BW x 10
	- For extreme weight loss (generally not recommended)
		- BW x 9
		- BW x 8 
		- BW x 7
## Tracking your nutrition
### My approach
- I use a spreadsheet to track my daily calorie and protein intake. If you're curious what the spreadsheet looks like and/or would like a copy of it, feel free to [reach out](https://heidihuang.netlify.app/contact)!
- I do not track any of my other macros
### Calorie tracking apps
- MyFitnessPal 
- Cronometer
- MacroFactor - not free, though
### Resources
Resource: https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/bb90l0/most_accurate_bmrtdee_calculator/ 
- Calculate your BMR using an online BMR calculator
- Calculate your TDEE using the Harrison-Benedict equation (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u4tpODih2s - Will Tennyson's video)
- For weight loss: eat 300-500 cal fewer than your TDEE
# Cardio
## Tips
Make cardio fun for *you*. There is a lot of room to do introduce variety to your cardio workouts: swimming, biking, hiking, playing basketball, dancing, etc.

If you look hard enough, there will be an activity you enjoy. Find what it is and do it. Find other people who enjoy the same activity and do it together. 

Aim to do at least 120 min of cardio a week.
## My approach
- I love playing basketball and hiking. 
- I have a jump rope (cheap, accessible, you can jump rope anywhere).
- I used to hate running, but I like it now! The best part about running is that you can do it literally anywhere.

# Conclusion
**Sustainable** fitness (something you'll keep doing for the rest of your life) is about finding a diet and exercises that work for *you* - your schedule, your likes and dislikes, your life.

Are there days in which I feel lazy and slack off? Absolutely. 
But it's better to be imperfectly consistent than perfectly inconsistent. 
Don't let a couple of failures throw you off. You're not going to lose all your gains because you stopped working out for a few weeks.

As long as you don't let failing become a habit (useful tip: Matt d'Avella's 2 day rule), you're good.
