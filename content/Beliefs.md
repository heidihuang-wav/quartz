This page provides some insight into my thoughts, likes, and dislikes. If something resonates with you or simply intrigues you, feel free to reach out through the contact form just below the title of this page. Letâ€™s chat!
## Beliefs
- Is a hot dog a sandwich? No. According to the [Cube Rule of Food Identification](https://cuberule.com/), a hot dog is a taco.
- [School is not enough](https://www.palladiummag.com/2023/06/06/school-is-not-enough/). More meaningful early experiences and opportunities for agency outside conventional schooling paths, please.
- More [walkable and bikable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxykI30fS54) cities, please. 
- Act fast. The benefits of [being impatient](https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/) compound. 
- [Conviction](https://blog.aayushg.com/fake_conviction/) is the scarcest resource, not time.

## Parenting 
I don't have kids. But, if that changes, here are some ideas for what I'd do, based on my own experiences as a kid.
- The [Hard Thing Rule](https://characterlab.org/character-hub/resources/grit-the-power-of-passion-and-perseverance/) from *Grit* by Angela Duckworth: A **hard thing** is something that requires daily, deliberate practice
	- Purpose: to encourage grit while allowing the child to choose their own path
	1. Everyone in the family does a hard thing (including the parents) 
	2. No quitting the hard thing in the middle (you can quit at a natural stopping point, but no quitting after a bad day)
	3. *You* choose your hard thing based on your interests (no one else chooses it for you)
