üåâ And, more broadly, the San Francisco Bay Area 
## I've been...
- Learning mainly Portuguese + some Cantonese on Duolingo
- Spending more time in lab
- Kinda burnt out - Fall 2023 is a semester with tough classes and many commitments, and I haven't really taken an actual, extended break since Fall 2021 - I need to figure something out.
- Having the occasional "what am I gonna do after graduation" crisis
- Gradually figuring out what I want to do through a long, non-linear process of elimination
## Fun stuff
- Hikes
- Weightlifting
- Occasional basketball @ random parks in the city
- Better Call Saul
- Putting together a progressive house DJ set, like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhPa0XYA5DA&t=1888s)
