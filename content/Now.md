>[!info] What I'm up to these days. Updated monthly.
## Location
üìç Berkeley, California, USA <br> 
üåâ And, more broadly, the San Francisco Bay Area 
## Current obsessions: I've been...
- Learning mainly Portuguese on Duolingo
- Trying to gain a more fundamental understanding of my postdoc mentor's / my lab's research
	- The process of writing a research proposal for my senior thesis has helped with this tremendously
- Gradually figuring out what I want to do through a long, non-linear process of elimination
	- Emphasis on "non-linear" as of late. I dropped the Public Health major and am now only majoring in Molecular and Cell Biology. I've always been interested in becoming a physician, but I've been considering the MD-PhD path more seriously. Research has really grown on me! MD-PhD is 8 years of training, not counting residency, though...
