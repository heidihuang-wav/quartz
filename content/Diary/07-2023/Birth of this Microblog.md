Dunno what I'm doing but this is cool :) and makes me very happy!

Took me way too long to realize the reason this wasn't working was because I don't know how to read instructions lol. Read more closely next time. 

## Recent Observation
Observation: projects / things I do in my own time tend to be...tech / computer-y, e.g.
- this very website
- learning web dev (making my personal website and blog)
- proposing an NLP-related project regarding transplant

which is different from what I major in (MCB, Public Health). 

So...
- what is this telling me? 
- how can i make use of this information?
