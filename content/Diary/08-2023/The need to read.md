## Reading
This story probably sounds familiar to many people. 

I used to love books as a kid—*Goosebumps*, the *Percy Jackson* series, you name it—I could read for hours on end without needing a break. As I got older, reading felt like a drag. During my middle school and high school years, if I had spare time, reading would've been my last choice activity with which to fill that time.

As high school drew to a close, my perception of reading still carried the weight of a chore. I knew I *wanted* to start reading again, but I'd tell myself "I don't have time", "I don't know how to make reading feel enjoyable", and "I don't know where to start." Graduating from high school at the peak of COVID-19 in Taiwan, though, the subsequent summer vacation and lockdown—months stuck at home with nowhere to go—gave me the chance to test the waters and pick up a book again.

That book turned out to be [[Book List |Things Fall Apart]] by Chinua Achebe. Super random. I had a hard copy of it since we were assigned to read it for my AP Literature class, but I'd never actually read it (thanks Sparknotes). 

What truly made a difference was having unstructured and (what felt like) unlimited time during those three months. A summer without school imposing external constraints meant a summer spent doing things as an **active choice** rather than as a response to hit goals set by others and meet arbitrary deadlines. 

In a few days, I finished reading *Things Fall Apart* and enjoyed the experience, proving to myself I *could* still finish books, an ability I'd begun to doubt I still had after it'd been so long since I'd read any book from cover to cover. 

But, after that summer, after that brief victory, nothing changed about my reading (or lack thereof) habits. If anything, starting college, moving to the Bay Area, living on my own for the first time, meeting new people, and getting adjusted to the rigor of college classes made me put reading on the back burner. 

It wasn't until the end of freshman year that I tried audio books, which turned out to be a complete game-changer. Ever since then, I've started filling up idle time—time spent putting together Ikea furniture, cooking, or walking to campus—with audio books, and my biggest takeaway from doing this is the ==**importance of consistency==.** Carving out fifteen minutes to read while waiting for the bus whenever you can, or chipping away an hour by listening to an audiobook every three days while cooking accumulates into a meaningful progression over time.

That is not to say one should be filling every spare minute they have with content. When I made the mistake of trying to replace *all* my downtime with content consumption, namely listening to audiobooks and podcasts, I felt overwhelmed. I felt guilty if I wasn't being "productive" every minute of the day. I love music. I spent 68,000 hours listening to music in 2022 according to Spotify Wrapped), but I felt bad for listening to music when I could be listening to something "useful" instead.

Nope. Not falling into that trap of toxic productivity again. 

While I unintentionally developed a counterproductive mindset when I first got into audiobooks that I later recalibrated, they most importantly became the gateway to establishing reading as a habit. The convenience of engaging with an audiobook while doing some other activity involves much less friction than blocking out hours exclusively to sit down and read, and friction reduction is especially important during the initial phases of building any habit.

I kept listening to audiobooks, and I found myself also reaching for ebooks on my phone, PDFs on a Kindle, and physical books, initially because some books, meant to be interactive or perhaps rich in diagrams and charts, aren't meant to be listened to. In any case, the medium was never what mattered.
