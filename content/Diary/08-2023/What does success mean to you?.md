To my future self, 

I hope you're **healthy**, both physically and mentally. Seriously, health is the number one priority. Lift weights and do some form of cardio, no matter how old you may be. Have sustainable eating habits and sleep patterns.

I hope you're still **endlessly curious** about the world. Keep a relentless desire to experience all that the world has to offer. Ask questions, strike up conversations about topics with which you are unfamiliar, do things that [[Books/Hell Yeah or No|scare you]]. ==üó∫Ô∏è May the beauty of exploration and experimentation never fade.==

I hope you are a **compassionate and supportive friend, partner, family member, and community member**. Cultivate meaningful relationships. Life can get busy, so I hope you have the ability to discern what and who to prioritize. Thank these folks and let them know how much they mean to you from time to time. 

Professionally, I hope you've been able to **find your focus** and *really* go **deep**. Ask big questions. Learn whatever you need to achieve your professional goals and what you're curious about, regardless of whether or not those things are "in your field." What are the boundaries of our current knowledge, and what's stopping us? 

I hope you are **grounded, self-assured, and confident** in your values and who you are. It's okay to say no. Have the courage to be disliked. 

Lastly, I hope you are **kind**‚Äîto others and to yourself ü´Ä.

Warmly, 

Your present self (08.01.2023)
