## Serendipity and math
$Luck = f(A, E) = f(D, S, E)$

Luck is a function of 
- $A$ - Surface Area.
- $E$ - External Factors. Out of our control.

Surface area can be further broken down into  $A = D + S$
- $D$ - Doing. Encompasses both consuming and creating.
- $S$ - Showcasing. Echoes "working with my garage door up" on the [[_index| home page]] and is the reason for the [[Daily Notes/Birth of this Microblog]]

## File management
Need to figure out internal organization for this microblog. Or not. Could just go with the flow. This site is meant to be low maintenance anyway.

## Health 
Tend to take it for granted until something comes up. 
Type up on notes on Being Mortal.
