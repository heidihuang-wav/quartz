Dunno what I'm doing but this is cool :) And free!

Took me way too long to realize the reason this wasn't working was because I don't know how to read instructions lol. Read more closely next time.

- this very website
- learning web dev (making my personal website and blog)
- proposing an NLP-related project regarding transplant
