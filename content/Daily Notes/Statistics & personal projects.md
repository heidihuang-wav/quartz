## Personal Projects
A [[Daily Notes/Birth of this Microblog#Recent Observation|recent observation]] of the kinds of personal projects I pursue has prompted me to ask myself this question:
> If I had an infinite amount of money and time, would I still be doing what I'm doing? Would my professional pursuits be the same? 

I hesitated before answering yes to this question, which alarmed me. After thinking about this, I recognize the reason for my hesitation is my impatience. 
- The alternative: software, tech startups.
- The question: so, why not software?
	- My primary interest lies in healthcare and the life sciences. This has been true for as long as I can remember. 
	- I also know there is exactly a ***0% chance*** I will be exceptional in the area if I go for software. Chances are still extremely slim with molecular therapeutics, but it's not 0.
- The bottom line: I want to help build something to help people. Ideally, to help improve health outcomes.
- Source of my frustration: biotech seems to be much more regulated and slow-moving compared to software/tech startups
- What I want to do: biotech
- What I'm on the path to doing (and what matters most at the end of the day): biotech 
	- cool, what I want to do and what I'm on the path to doing align. that's all i need to know.
