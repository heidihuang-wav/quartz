These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.\n- **Shallow work**: Non-cognitively demanding tasks that are often done while distracted which are easy to replicate and do not create a lot of value in the world.\n- **The Deep Work Hypothesis**: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.\n## Part 1: The Idea\n- Deep work is valuable\n\t- 2 core abilities for thriving in the new economy\n\t\t1. The ability to quickly master hard things\n\t\t2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed\n\t- High-quality work produced = (time spent) * (intensity of focus)\n- Deep work is rare\n\t- **Principle of least resistance**: in a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment\n\t- **Business as a proxy for productivity**: in the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner\n- Deep work is meaningful\n\t- [[Books/Flow|Flow]]\n\t- Stretching your mind to its limits, concentrating, losing yourself in an activity - being in a flow state generates happiness\n\t- You don't need a rarified job; instead, you need a rarified approach to your work\n## Part 2: The Rules\n### Rule 1: Work Deeply\n\u003e The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add¬†_routines_¬†and¬†_rituals_¬†to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.\n- 4 different philosophies of deep work - what works best for you?\n\t1. Monastic: maximize deep efforts by radically minimizing shallow obligations (not realistic for most)\n\t2. Bimodal: divide your time; dedicating clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leave the rest open to everything else\n\t3. Rhythmic: turn deep work sessions into a regular habit; find a regular rhythm for this work that removes the need to invest energy and thought into deciding if, when, and where you're' going to go deep\n\t4. Journalistic: whenever you can find some free time, go into deep work mode. Difficult and not feasible for most, especially beginners at deep work, because requires the ability to switch between modes (deep work vs. regular mode) instantly.\n- Build a ritual to help you prepare for deep work and include:\n\t1. Where you'll work \n\t2. For how long you'll work\n\t3. How you'll work once you start to work \n\t4. Planned breaks to help you recharge and refocus\n- Make **grand gestures** - significant changes to your environment by investing time/effort/money to increase the *perceived importance* of a task helps improve focus and motivation\n\t- imo going to a coffee shop is enough of a grand gesture; no need to book a hotel room or anything\n- Execute like a business by using the **4DX framework** - based on idea that execution is more difficult than strategizing\n\t1. Focus on the wildly important - \"the more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish\"\n\t2. Act on the lead measures \n\t\t1. lag measures: metric you're ultimately trying to improve (but they come too late to change your immediate behavior)\n\t\t2. lead measures: measure new behaviors that will drive success on lag measures (improving behaviors you can control now that will have a positive focus in the future/on your long-term goals)\n\t4. Keep a compelling scorecard (record and track lead measures publicly)\n\t\t- e.g. tracking hours spent working deeply will help calibrate your understanding of how many deep work hours are needed to get to a milestone\n\t5.  Create a cadence of accountability\n\t\t- Team members must confront their scoreboard and commit to actions they will make to improve their score, and describe what happened to their commitments at the last meeting \n\t\t-  if no team, create regular accountability for yourself; do a weekly review to look at your scorecard and see how you're doing\n- Be \"lazy\"\n\t- idleness if indispensable to the brain / our well-being\n\t- at the end of the work day, shut down work thinking completely; if you need more time, extend your workday\n\t\t- consider a **shut-down ritual** (e.g. check your calendar, check your inboxes, make sure there's nothing urgent left to do for the day, plan out our next day ‚û°Ô∏è shut-down complete)\n\t- downtime aids insights! (note: balance between consumption and creation) \n\t- some things are better left to our unconscious mind to untangle\n\n### Rule 2: Embrace Boredom\n- Schedule occasional break from focus to give into distraction\n- **Productive meditation**: focus on a specific problem while doing something physical (e.g. running, walking)\n- Try identifying a deep task, give yourself a self-imposed hard deadline that significantly reduces the time you typically allot for it, and work with intensity to complete the task by the deadline\n### Rule 3: Quit Social Media\n- Don't use the Internet to entertain yourself\n- **The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection**: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool *only* if its positive impacts on these factors *substantially* outweigh its negative impacts.\n- **The Law of the Vital Few:**¬†In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.\n- Put more thought into your leisure time - give yourself something meaningful to do rather than defaulting to scrolling through social media after coming from work\n### Rule 4: Drain the Shallows\n- Batch shallow work into groups (2-3 / day)\n- Shallow work is not inherently bad; shallow work only becomes a problem if eats into your available deep work hours\n\n## Applying *Deep Work* \n- I've started time-tracking my work using Working Hours (iOS app) \n\t- This practice may not be permanent, but I want to quantify how much deep work I *actually* accomplish in a day\n\t- I'll try to gain some insights from the number of hours I spend working \n- Scheduling time blocks a day in advance \n\t- I usually have a to-do list, so I know what I want to accomplish for that day, but scheduling things out has been helpful\n\t- It's also been somewhat of a stressful practice because things usually never go to plan ","lastmodified":"2023-11-09T01:51:07.99100079Z","tags":["Book"]},"/Books/Flow":{"title":"Flow","content":"\u003e [!info] [Link](https://heidi-huang.ghost.io/flow-the-psychology-of-optimal-experience/) to my blog post\n\n### My Thoughts on _Flow_ (Overall)\n- Cool blend of science (biology, psychology, etc.) and philosophy\n- Defines happiness and guides readers through the journey of the pursuit of happiness\n\n## Notes\n### 8 Elements of Enjoyment\n1.

React to this in 2 ways:\n\t1. Stop lying to yourself and admit your real priorities\n\t2. Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it's really true\n- Success comes from *doing*, not declaring.\n- Speak in the present tense only about what you're actually currently doing. Let go of past identities.\n- Whatever you decide, optimize for that goal, and be willing to *let go* of the others\n\t- My take: if you have more than X (X == 2, 3, idk) priorities, then none of them are priorities at all. 'cause ya simply can't focus on everything all at once\n- If you expect criticism in advance and take pride in your stance (however unusual it may be), you can bash on with a smile, being who you want to be.\n- Look around at existing ideas in the world. You can imitate them and still offer something unique.\n- Old opinions shouldn't define who we are in the future. Because they can change at any moment due to whatever experiences you go through.\n- Public comments are just feedback on something you made; they are not a reflection of who you are as a person.\n- Character is a result of your little choices and little actions. How you do anything is how you do everything.\n- Both a present-focused future-focused mindsets are necessary. A present-focus helps you enjoy life, but a future-focus helps you stay disciplined.\n- Small actions change your self-identity. \n\t- My take: It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. For instance, you take the first step and start exercising, you convince yourself you are someone who exercises, which further encourages you to exercise the next day, and the day after that.\n## Saying no \n- Refuse almost everything. Do almost nothing. But the things you do, do them all the way\n\t- If you‚Äôre not feeling ‚ÄúHell yeah, that would be awesome!‚Äù about something, say no. It‚Äôs an easier decision.\n- Art is useless; it's just for me ‚Äî I'm playing music for its own sake and loving it.\n- Your first reaction is usually outdated\n\t- When you‚Äôre less impulsive and more deliberate like this, it can be a little inconvenient for other people, but that‚Äôs OK.

Ask myself what‚Äôs wrong in this very second. Am I in physical pain or danger? No. I‚Äôve got mental pain, but that‚Äôs just me imagining things or remembering things. None of it is real.\n\t2.

Focus your efforts/energy/attention where they matter.\n- Silence is a great canvas for your thoughts\n\t- Be disconnected, focus, do deep work\n- Some people think they need expensive equipment to start a new hobby, certain clothes to look the part, or for everything to be just right. But resourceful people know they don‚Äôt.\n- Change your focus. Instead of comparing up to the next higher situation, compare down to the next-lower one.\n- You need to be more grateful for what you‚Äôve got, for how much worse it could have been, and how nice it is to have anything at all. Ambition versus gratitude. Comparing up versus comparing down\n- Do you have a list of conditions you need to have met before you do something? Try changing the requirements (A *and* B) from and to \"or.\"\n\t- Reduce the activation energy required for you to take action\n- There are always more than two options. Open your mind to them.\n- Early in your career, the best strategy is to say yes to everything. The more things you try, and the more people you meet, the better. Each one might lead to your lucky break. Then when something is extra-rewarding, it‚Äôs time to switch strategies. Focus all of your energy on this one thing.\n- Think long-term; don't be paralyzed by the abundance of options\n- Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years\n## Changing Perspective\n- To assume you‚Äôre below average is to admit you‚Äôre still learning. You focus on what you need to improve\n- Embrace radical responsibility\n\t- Now you‚Äôre the person who made things happen, made a mistake, and can learn from it. Now you‚Äôre in control and there‚Äôs nothing to complain about.\n- I like to think that everything is a coincidence. Life feels more amazing to me if it has no meaning. No secret agenda.

Don‚Äôt choose a name. Don‚Äôt make a website or an app. Don‚Äôt build a system. You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea.\n## Fixing faulty thinking \n- Deliberate unlearning:\n\t1. Doubt what I know. \n\t2. Stop the habit of thinking I know it. \n\t3. Require current proof that it‚Äôs still true today. Otherwise, let it go.\n- Most successful people I know have a narrow focus, protect themselves against time-wasters, say no to almost everything, and have let go of old limiting beliefs.\n- Look instead at what to remove.\n- Smart people don't think others are stupid: being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions\n- What matters is what I get out of their work, not the person who made it.\n- We think the differences between our group and another group are greater than they are.\n- To get smarter, you need to get surprised, think in new ways, and deeply understand different perspectives.\n- To make a change, you have to be extreme.

One of the most perilous areas along the border is the Sonoran Desert, which stretches from California to Mexico and is known for its harsh terrain and extreme temperatures. Unlike other more urban areas of entry, which offer some level of infrastructure, crossing the Sonoran Desert requires migrants to navigate remote areas with limited access to food, water, and medical care. For many migrants, the journey through the Sonoran Desert is a matter of life and death, with countless individuals perishing from dehydration, heat stroke, and other forms of trauma. In The Land of Open Graves, Jason de Le√≥n delves into the complexity and violence of migration through the Sonoran Desert, highlighting the human toll of a border policy that seeks to render the experiences of undocumented migrants invisible. As the book‚Äôs central quotation states, ‚Äúthe Border Patrol disguises the impact of its current enforcement policy by mobilizing a combination of sterilized discourse, redirected blame, and ‚Äònatural‚Äô environmental processes that erase evidence of what happens in the most remote parts of southern Arizona. The goal is to render invisible the innumerable consequences this sociopolitical phenomenon has for the lives and bodies of undocumented people. Those who live and die in the desert have names, faces, and families. They also have complicated life histories that reflect an intimate relationship with transnational migration and global economic inequality.‚Äù (de Le√≥n 2015, 4-5). Through employing a mixed-methods approach, drawing on fields such as forensics, anthropology, and archaeology, de Le√≥n examines the complex forms of violence perpetrated by the hybrid collectif in the context of migration, shedding light on how this violence results in the death of migrants, the mistreatment of their bodies postmortem, and the broader implications of such violence, including the experience of ambiguous loss among family members and the impact on children left behind.¬†\n\nDe Le√≥n employs a semi-fictionalized ethnographic approach to illustrate the theme of violence and the harsh reality of border crossings as caused by Prevention Through Deterrence (PTD), a border enforcement strategy implemented by the US government based on the idea that making crossing more treacherous will discourage people from attempting to cross in the first place. Under this strategy, the government has implemented various tactics, such as increasing border security, fencing, and surveillance and funneling migrants toward the Sonoran Desert, a challenging terrain with extreme temperatures and limited access to resources necessary for survival. He bases the stories of ‚ÄúLupe, Carlos, Marcos, and Javier‚Äù on hundreds of interviews with migrants over the years to combat the dehumanization and erasure of violence perpetuated by PTD (de Le√≥n 2015, 59). By incorporating these semi-fictional stories, de Le√≥n provides a human face to the otherwise faceless issue of border crossing, allowing readers to empathize with migrants and see them as individuals rather than statistics on a page.¬†\n\nTo further expose the brutal reality of PTD and its effects on the lives of real people, de Le√≥n draws on methods from contemporary archaeology to gain insight into migrants‚Äô intentions, experiences, and physical suffering they endured during their journey. For example, De Le√≥n finds a pair of worn-out shoes whose ‚Äúsole has been separated from the upper‚Äù and has been repaired by a ‚Äúbra strap‚Äù (de Le√≥n 2015, 181). This modification indicates the shoe owner‚Äôs desperation to keep moving despite worn-out footwear, highlighting the harsh reality of the environmental conditions migrants must endure, such as blistered feet, as they walk for miles through difficult terrain. De Le√≥n's use of contemporary archaeology also provides insight into the economic and social factors driving migration. By examining objects left behind, such as ‚Äúblack and camouflage‚Äù backpacks, clothing, and water bottles, he can understand the strategies migrants use to carry personal belongings and other necessities to face (de Le√≥n 2015, 160). While these strategies highlight migrants‚Äô resourcefulness and resilience in the face of the Sonoran desert's challenges, they also underscore the violence inherent in US immigration policy that pushes migrants to undertake dangerous journeys and how the desert, intersecting with human actants, shape the experiences and outcomes of migration. ChatGPT indeed corroborates the role of the Sonoran Desert‚Äôs ‚Äúharsh and unforgiving landscape‚Äù in deterring migrants from crossing the border, but it mistakenly describes ‚Äúcanines‚Äù as the ‚Äúmost prominent‚Äù example of nonhuman agency in de Le√≥n‚Äôs book. Canines do consume human flesh and contribute to destroying migrants‚Äô bodies, but they are not the main focus of the author‚Äôs discussion surrounding nonhuman forces which act as agents of deterrence and violence.\n\nThe violence inflicted upon migrants by the hybrid collectif does not stop at death, however. In fact, de Le√≥n captures continued violence postmortem, a phenomenon also known as necroviolence, through the use of experimentation with pig carcasses, explicit photos, and in-depth analyses of violent practices. To recreate the necroviolence that occurs at the US-Mexico border, de Le√≥n conducts experiments with pig carcasses to understand how the environment and the hybrid collectif contribute to the postmortem violence inflicted upon migrant bodies. Observing what happens to a pig carcass days after death‚Äî‚Äúripped apart...devoured by vultures‚Ä¶\\[and] scattered to the wind‚Äù‚Äîthe author finds that the harsh environmental conditions allow for the desecration of migrant bodies, which become unidentifiable and sometimes destroyed altogether (de Le√≥n 2015, 82). He supplements his text with images that vividly depict the destruction of pig carcasses in just a few days. These visuals, in addition to photos of border crossers‚Äô left-behind personal belongings, provide concrete evidence of the necroviolence that takes place at the US-Mexico border. ChatGPT erroneously states that de Le√≥n believes including ‚Äúphotographs of migrants' bodies and personal belongings \\[contributes] to their objectification and exploitation.‚Äù From the beginning, de Le√≥n makes clear that ‚Äúwords alone could never capture the complexity, emotion, or realities of the violence, suffering, and victories‚Äù migrants experience (de Le√≥n 2015, 18). Including images and faces is, therefore, the author‚Äôs attempt at humanizing undocumented migrants and the process of border crossing rather than an attempt to capitalize on graphic images for the sake of sensationalism. De Le√≥n also takes great care to ensure that his research was conducted ethically and responsibly. Although he shows migrants' faces and uses real names for deceased members, he is sensitive to the potential harm that his research could cause to the migrants he studies and to the communities he works with, so he takes steps to protect the privacy and anonymity of his research subjects, using pseudonyms and changing identifying details to prevent their identification when necessary. ChatGPT‚Äôs statements align with this claim and confirm that ‚Äúhuman values‚Äù and ethical considerations should be at the forefront of decision-making, even in the pursuit of academic or professional goals.¬†\n\nAdditionally, the author argues that the state‚Äôs perception of the US-Mexico border as a ‚Äúspace of exception‚Äù contributes to the necropolitics of the border by creating a zone where the suspension of human and constitutional rights is justified in the name of national security (de Le√≥n 2015, 68). As ChatGPT writes, these ‚Äú‚Äònecropolitical‚Äô policies‚Äù lead to the ‚Äúdehumanization and neglect of‚Äù both ‚Äúliving and dead‚Äù migrants. Indeed, the continued violence inflicted upon migrant bodies, even in death, is a potent reminder of the power dynamics at play in the hybrid collectif and the ways in which the Sonoran Desert and other environmental factors contribute to the state's exercise of power over migrant bodies.\n\nDe Le√≥n's exploration of the hybrid collectif's violence extends beyond the migrants who attempt to cross the border, as it also affects their families and loved ones left behind. He recounts the story of Maricela, a migrant who died in the desert and suffered the aftermath of the hybrid collectif's brutality. The majority of Latin America's population is Catholic, and ‚Äúviewing the body is a key element of mourning‚Äù (de Le√≥n 2015, 253). Thus, the destruction of the corpse poses a significant threat for two religious reasons: first, the absence of the body rules out the possibility of holding a wake and building a grave for family members to visit and pray; second, a damaged or incomplete corpse is perceived as a threat to the afterlife since it may prevent people from rising from the dead for judgment. The hybrid collectif's violation of Catholic burial norms in the desert is \"symbolically potent, as an exceptional and avowedly demeaning act\" (de Le√≥n 2015, 83). The nonhuman actant that is the Sonoran Desert plays a significant role in the hybrid collectif's violence towards migrants, as it not only deters them and brings about death but also inflicts further harm upon their families and religious beliefs.\n\nThe US-Mexico border, particularly the Sonoran Desert, serves as a site of contested power and violence, and The Land of Open Graves explores the human toll of migration through this harsh terrain. By using a mixed-methods approach, including semi-fictionalized ethnography and contemporary archaeology, de Le√≥n illustrates the violence inherent in PTD and highlights the impact it has on the lives of real people. Furthermore, de Le√≥n exposes the continued violence inflicted upon migrants postmortem, a phenomenon known as necroviolence, through experimentation with pig carcasses and in-depth analyses of violent practices. The Land of Open Graves provides a powerful and insightful examination of the experiences of undocumented migrants and the impact of US border policy, reminding readers of the human cost of the ongoing border crisis. By revealing the human consequences of the immigration security paradigm, de Le√≥n's work highlights the urgent need for more humane and just policies to address the challenges facing migrants today.","lastmodified":"2023-11-09T01:51:07.995000823Z","tags":["Book"]},"/Cell-culture-tips":{"title":"Cell culture tips","content":"As my postdoc / mentor likes to say, \n\u003e Trust no one\n\n## Tips\n- Before each use\n\t- Make sure sash is at the correct height \n\t- Wipe down hood thoroughly with booze (70% ethanol) before starting and after each use\n- Sterile handling\n\t- Spray down *everything* that goes into the hood with booze, including \n\t\t- First time putting your hands and arms into the hood: spray your gloved hands + a little bit up your sleeve\n\t\t- Every time your hands exit the hood, spray them with booze again before putting them back into the hood\n\t- Switch Pasteur pipette tips at at least between different cell types\n\t- Apparently a controversial statement, but keep lids and caps facing up \n\t- Avoid sucking up media into serological pipette gun \n\t- Keep lids and caps on as often as possible\n\t- Try your best to not touch the inside of dishes and flasks with pipettes and tips\n- Organization\n\t- Keep objects out of the vent at the front of the hood (push things inside the hood)\n\t- Try not to pass hands, bottles, pipettes, tubes etc. over any open and uncovered media bottles, uncovered plates, and opened tips\n- After each use\n\t- UV \n\t- Wipe everything down with booze\n\t- Vacuum tube: spray with bleach + booze\n","lastmodified":"2023-11-09T01:51:07.995000823Z","tags":["Biology"]},"/Efficient-genome-editing-in-the-mouse-brain-by-local-delivery-of-engineered-Cas9-RNP-complexes":{"title":"Efficient genome editing in the mouse brain by local delivery of engineered Cas9 RNP complexes","content":"\u003e [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3806) to paper\n\n## Summary\n1. The study demonstrates efficient genome editing in post-mitotic neurons of the adult mouse brain using Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes -\u003e holds promise for correcting/inactivating genetic causes of neurological diseases characterized by specific neuronal populations via safe Cas9 delivery with minimal immune response \n2. Engineered Cas9 variants with multiple SV40 nuclear localization sequences (NLS) enhance the efficiency of neuronal genome editing *in vivo* by 10x, addressing the challenge of tissue-specific delivery\n3. Mouse model Ai9 tdTomato is used to detect Cas9 editing, providing a quantitative method for genome modification. Specific guide RNAs activate tdTomato expression in genetically modified cells. \n4. Increasing the number of NLS sequences on Cas9 improves cell penetration and editing efficiency in cultured cells. Mixing RNPs with Lipofectamine2000 (transfection reagent) also facilitates RNP delivery into the cytoplasm in various cell types. \n\n## Other Notes\n### Background \n\u003e what is the gap in knowledge this research is trying to address?\n- Previous studies have shown the utility of Cas9-mediated genome editing in various tissues, but the challenge of tissue-specific delivery, especially in the complex neural environment, remain a significant hurdle\n### Hypothesis\n The engineered Cas9 RNP complexes with multiple NLS will enhance the efficiency of genome editing in neurons within the adult mouse brain. \n\t- These RNPs can overcome issues related to tissue-specific delivery, immune responses, and off-target effects, making them a more promising tool for correcting genetic causes of neurological diseases.\n### Experiments\n1. Testing different Cas9 RNP variants with varying NLS sequences in cultured cells and in the adult mouse brain. \n2. Stereotaxic injections of RNPs targeting tdTomato in various brain regions and subsequent analysis of edited cells.\n3. Dual-color immunofluorescence to identify the specific neuronal subtypes edited by 4xNLS-Cas9-2xNLS RNPs. \n4. Dose-dependent experiments to assess the effect of RNP quantity on the number and volume of edited cells. \n5. Analysis of microglia activation and immune response in the brain following RNP injection.\n### Observations and Conclusions\n1. Engineered Cas9 RNP complexes, particularly the 4√óNLS-Cas9-2√óNLS variant, demonstrate a tenfold increase in efficiency for genome editing in neurons within the adult mouse brain, effectively addressing the challenge of tissue-specific delivery.\n2. In vivo genome editing with these RNPs is specific to the target gene (tdTomato), showing that RNPs are precise and do not result in off-target effects.\n3. The RNP-mediated editing is observed in various neuronal subtypes within the brain, confirming the potential for neuron-specific targeting and treatment of genetic neurological diseases.\n4. Increasing the RNP dose leads to a higher number and volume of genome-edited cells, indicating a dose-dependent response to RNP delivery.\n5. The study shows minimal immune response to Cas9 RNPs injected into the brain, suggesting the feasibility of safe and precise Cas9-RNP delivery for therapeutic purposes.\n### Iteration / Future Directions\n1.  Further exploration of the mechanisms underlying the in vivo neurotropism of 4√óNLS-Cas9-2√óNLS RNPs to understand how they specifically target neurons, potentially leading to the development of even more efficient delivery methods.\n2. Additional research to assess the safety and potential adaptive responses in the context of therapeutic Cas9-RNP delivery, with a focus on minimizing any immune-related side effects.\n","lastmodified":"2023-11-09T01:51:07.995000823Z","tags":[]},"/Excalidraw/Drawing-2023-07-31-20.31.04.excalidraw":{"title":"Drawing 2023-07-31 20.31.04.excalidraw","content":"==‚ö†  Switch to EXCALIDRAW VIEW in the MORE OPTIONS menu of this document. ‚ö†==\n\n\n# Text Elements\nNow Us üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n ^j7yIhgsn\n\nNow Me üë∂ ^PEpmR0lx\n\nFuture Us üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ ^J9KaOCq6\n\nFuture Me üëµ ^mMqLEfNW\n\n1.

Short (~130 pages maybe) read. Book is high in value per word. \n\nüëâ Full book notes [[Books/Hell Yeah or No|here]].\n\n### Highlights so far from Part 1 / 3 of the book: \"Updating Identity\"\n- Choose the local vs. global balance that works for you (being useful to your immediate, local community vs. the world).\n- Your *actions* show you what you actually want. React to this in 2 ways:\n\t1. Stop lying to yourself and admit your real priorities\n\t2. Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it's really true\n- Success comes from *doing*, not declaring.\n- Speak in the present tense only about what you're actually currently doing. Let go of past identities.\n- Whatever you decide, optimize for that goal, and be willing to *let go* of the others\n\t- My take: if you have more than X (X == 2, 3, idk) priorities, then none of them are priorities at all. 'cause ya simply can't focus on everything all at once\n- If you expect criticism in advance and take pride in your stance (however unusual it may be), you can bash on with a smile, being who you want to be.\n- Look around at existing ideas in the world. You can imitate them and still offer something unique.\n- Old opinions shouldn't define who we are in the future. Because they can change at any moment due to whatever experiences you go through.\n- Public comments are just feedback on something you made; they are not a reflection of who you are as a person.\n- Character is a result of your little choices and little actions. How you do anything is how you do everything.\n- Both a present-focused future-focused mindsets are necessary. A present-focus helps you enjoy life, but a future-focus helps you stay disciplined.\n- Small actions change your self-identity. \n\t- My take: It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. For instance, you take the first step and start exercising, you convince yourself you are someone who exercises, which further encourages you to exercise the next day, and the day after that.","lastmodified":"2023-11-09T01:51:08.063001377Z","tags":["Journal-2023"]},"/Journal/07-2023/Serendipity-file-management-health":{"title":"Serendipity, file management, health","content":"## Serendipity and math\n$Luck = f(A, E) = f(D, S, E)$\n\nLuck is a function of \n- $A$ - Surface Area.\n- $E$ - External Factors.

As I got older, reading felt like a drag. During my middle school and high school years, if I had spare time, reading would've been my last choice activity with which to fill that time.\n\nAs high school drew to a close, my perception of reading still carried the weight of a chore. I knew I *wanted* to start reading again, but I'd tell myself \"I don't have time\", \"I don't know how to make reading feel enjoyable\", and \"I don't know where to start.\" Graduating from high school at the peak of COVID-19 in Taiwan, though, the subsequent summer vacation and lockdown‚Äîmonths stuck at home with nowhere to go‚Äîgave me the chance to test the waters and pick up a book again.\n\nThat book turned out to be [[Reading List|Things Fall Apart]] by Chinua Achebe. Super random. I had a hard copy of it since we were assigned to read it for my AP Literature class, but I'd never actually read it (thanks Sparknotes). \n\nWhat truly made a difference was having unstructured and (what felt like) unlimited time during those three months. A summer without school imposing external constraints meant a summer spent doing things as an **active choice** rather than as a response to hit goals set by others and meet arbitrary deadlines. \n\nIn a few days, I finished reading *Things Fall Apart* and enjoyed the experience, proving to myself I *could* still finish books, an ability I'd begun to doubt I still had after it'd been so long since I'd read any book from cover to cover. \n\nBut, after that summer, after that brief victory, nothing changed about my reading (or lack thereof) habits. If anything, starting college, moving to the Bay Area, living on my own for the first time, meeting new people, and getting adjusted to the rigor of college classes made me put reading on the back burner. \n\nIt wasn't until the end of freshman year that I tried audio books, which turned out to be a complete game-changer. Ever since then, I've started filling up idle time‚Äîtime spent putting together Ikea furniture, cooking, or walking to campus‚Äîwith audio books, and my biggest takeaway from doing this is the ==**importance of consistency==.** Carving out fifteen minutes to read while waiting for the bus, or chipping away an hour by listening to an audiobook every three days while cooking accumulates into a meaningful progression over time.\n\nThat is not to say one should be filling every spare minute they have with content. When I made the mistake of trying to replace *all* my downtime with content consumption, namely listening to audiobooks and podcasts, I felt overwhelmed. I felt guilty if I wasn't being \"productive\" every minute of the day. I love music. I spent 68,000 hours listening to music in 2022 according to Spotify Wrapped, but I felt bad for listening to music when I could be listening to something \"useful\" instead.\n\nNot falling into that trap of toxic productivity again. \n\nUnintentionally, I developed a counterproductive mindset when I first got into audiobooks that I later had to recalibrate. But audiobooks most importantly became the gateway to my establishing reading as a *habit*. The convenience of engaging with an audiobook while doing some other activity involves much less friction than blocking out hours exclusively to sit down and read, and friction reduction is especially important during the initial phases of building any habit.\n\nSo, I kept listening to audiobooks, and eventually, I found myself reaching for ebooks on my phone, PDFs on a Kindle, and physical books. Initially, this was because some books, interactive or rich in diagrams and charts, aren't meant to be listened to. In any case, the medium through which I read these books was never what mattered.\n\nWhat *does* matter is this: \n\u003e Reading...\\[trains] your model of the world. And even if you forget...what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003e ‚ÄîPaul Graham\n\nTake *The Housekeeper and the Professor,* for example. The short novel tells the heartwarming story of a mathematician with a short-term memory span of only 80 minutes, his bond with his dedicated housekeeper and her son, and the power of their relationship to transcend the limitations of memory.\n\nMath has never been my favorite subject, but I enjoyed feeling the professor's genuine enthusiasm for numbers, patterns, and the beauty of mathematical relationships through the pages of *The Housekeeper and the Professor.* The sight of the square root sign will now elicit a smile, thanks to the professor's portrayal of it as a generous symbol, a welcoming house for all numbers. Mathematical thinking doesn't have to be confined to academia. It can be a lens through which to view the world in all its intricate glory. The way the professor encouraged the housekeeper's son to think for himself and not be afraid to be wrong was inspiring and resonated with my inner child.\n\nBooks are also a compelling media form for these reasons:\n- **Depth of information**: when I think about the amount of information and possibly decades of expertise authors distill into several hours of reading, I find books to be such a steal.\n- **Deep Focus**\n\t- Reading a book requires sustained attention and focus. Maintaining deep focus for an extended period is a valuable skill (see [[Books/Deep Work|Deep Work]]), and reading helps me practice and get better at this skill. \n\t- I've found it difficult to both start projects *and* finish strong. Take songwriting, for example. I have tens of files sitting on my computer with 4-bar loops waiting to be turned into full-length songs. Reading books I set out to finish (I abandon some books on purpose) from cover to cover gets me into the habit of starting and finishing things.\n- **Personal Engagement, Imagination, and Interpretation**\n\t- **Engagement**: I control the pace at which I read. I can take notes, annotate, highlight, and be as careful and reflective with each page, or not, as I'd like. I also have the freedom to turn any notes into [blog posts](https://heidi-huang.ghost.io/) and essays to create a deeper, more personal connection with the material.\n\t- **Imagination**\n\t\t\u003e Fiction can show you a different world. It can take you somewhere you've never been. Once you've visited¬†other worlds, like those who ate fairy fruit, you can never be entirely content with the world that you grew up in. Discontent is a good thing: discontented people can modify and improve their worlds, leave them better, leave them different.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\u003e \t‚ÄîNeil Gaiman ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/24/neil-gaiman-face-facts-need-fiction))\n\t- **Interpretation**: When we engage with a text on a personal level, we become active participants in the storytelling process. I love hearing what other folks have to say about the same book I read.\n- **Improved Writing Skills**\n\n## Annual Personal Goal-Setting\n\nSo, reading is pretty darn cool. For all the reasons I mentioned above, I want ==to read a book every month== in 2023.

Make it obvious\n2. Make it attractive\n3. Make it easy\n4. Make it immediately satisfying\n\n---\n## How I plan on establishing this habit:\n\n- Making the cues obvious + reducing the friction needed for me to get movin'\n\t- Always have my basketball and jump rope lying around where I can _see_ them\n\t- Make clothes/shoes/socks easily accessible so I can get out of bed and leave my room/apartment/house\n- Make it attractive\n\t- I get to listen to an audiobook or music while exercising\n- Make it immediately satisfying\n\t- Mocha cappuccino flavored protein powder is seriously the best flavor out there y'all\n- Other strategies\n\t- Never bring laptop into bedroom (will decrease chances of me watching Netflix there and just lying/sitting on my bed for long periods doing nothing)\n\n## What is another habit I hope to establish in 2022?\n- Reading 1 book a month (or, at least, reading 8 books total in 2022)\n\n## How I plan on establishing this habit:\n\n- Listen to audiobooks!\n- Reasons\n\t- I can listen to books on the go, and I spend a fair amount of time commuting or doing tasks (e.g. washing the dishes, exercising) that don‚Äôt require my full attention\n\t- Paperback books are much more expensive, and I need to set aside dedicated time to read them. I also move around a lot, and physical books can be a hassle to transport. Hence why I‚Äôve been reading a grand total of zeeero books.\n\t- The biggest advantage of audiobooks is it will make reading much more accessible and convenient, and it is a cheaper alternative to physical books.\n\t- Audiobooks will aid me on my path to becoming a *reader - someone who regularly reads*\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-11-09T01:51:08.063001377Z","tags":[]},"/Yearly/2022-Mid-year-Check-in":{"title":"2022 Mid-year Check-in","content":"## Mid-Year Review (5/22/2022)\n\n### 1.

I just started reading *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\\*ck* a few days ago, and I‚Äôm already more than halfway through, but I started reading _The Healing of America_ a few weeks ago, and I‚Äôm far from being halfway through.\n- There‚Äôs a higher ‚Äúactivation energy‚Äù for reading paperback books.\n\n## Reflection\n\n- So far, so good (surprisingly? lol)\n- I need to keep up with goal #1 by spicing things up.\n\t- From now until 6/21 (I‚Äôll move back to campus and have access to the RSF), I‚Äôll switch things up - do cardio somedays (or every day) and do stuff with my 2 10-lb dumbbells\n\t- I think I also got bored of cardio cause it got repetitive (basketball and jump rope), so until I can use the RSF again introducing some variety should help.\n- Summer classes haven‚Äôt begun yet, so keeping up with goal #2 should be fairly easy to do. I‚Äôll just keep doing what I‚Äôve been doing. Once classes start again, with audiobooks, I should still be able to hit my goal. It‚Äôll just be a little more challenging.\n\n## Reminder: Why Did I Choose These Goals?\n\n1. Health. Also spending time outside makes me happy. Most of what I do (work, study, texting/calling, music, shows, etc.) consists of sitting on my ass, so it‚Äôs important to get moving. As I continue to study physiology, public health, and metabolic diseases, I want my identity to be associated with healthy living, so I should lead by example.\n2. To learn stuff outside of school (nonfiction). For fun (fiction). To discover new things and learn about the world. To get into the habit of lifelong learning.","lastmodified":"2023-11-09T01:51:08.063001377Z","tags":[]},"/Yearly/2023-Initial-Goal-Setting":{"title":"2023 Initial Goal Setting","content":"\nI want to read a book every month. That's twelve books in twelve months. \n\nThe number of books is arbitrary, really. I kinda just thought the repetition of twelve gives the name a nice ring. Reading twelve books in a year is not a lofty goal, but it's a realistic goal for my schedule. Things get very hectic during the semester (classes, research, clubs, people, internships), so reading anything more than 1 book / month is unrealistic. \n\nIn my [[Yearly/2022 Initial Goal Setting|2022 Initial Goal Setting]] page, I had planned to read a book a month in 2022, but I couldn't do it. This year, though, I've decided to make establishing reading as a habit my sole focus.\n\n## Reducing Friction\n1. Make it obvious\n\t- I always have my devices near me, so accessing books should be very easy.\n\t- I also brought 2 physical copies of books, so I can switch things up if I'm getting tired of reading from devices.\n2.  Make it attractive\n\t- Explore different genres and topics to keep my reading experiences diverse and engaging\n\t\t- I usually read less fiction, so reading more fiction is something I could explore.\n\t- I'm curious about the biotech industry and want to learn more, so this is a great opportunity to read up on biotech. \n\t- Talk to friends who also read. Share what you're reading with each other and ask if they have book recommendations, reviews, etc. Make it fun.\n3. Make it easy\n\t- Choose books that match my interests and preferences. It will be a lot easier to want to keep listening if I'm passionate about the subject matter. Besides, I'm not doing this for anyone else, so I have no reason not to.\n\t- Experiment with different formats, such as audiobooks or e-books, which can be convenient for on-the-go or multitasking situations.\n4. Make it immediately satisfying\n\t- After finishing a book, I'll take a moment to reflect on what I've learned or enjoyed from the reading. This sense of accomplishment can help reinforce the habit.\n\t- Annotate, take notes, and write long-form blog posts on books (if I want) to make the experience feel more meaningful and satisfying.","lastmodified":"2023-11-09T01:51:08.063001377Z","tags":[]},"/Yearly/2023-Mid-year-Check-in":{"title":"2023 Mid-year Check-in","content":"\nAccording to my [[Reading List]], I've read ten books as I'm writing this (08.21.2023).

From college applications to the daunting process of med school admissions, we‚Äôve been taught to dissect our every move, to analyze our motivations with a fine-toothed comb. And while having a strong sense of purpose can undoubtedly propel us forward, there comes a time when this relentless questioning might not be as necessary as we‚Äôve been led to believe.\n\nSure, having a clear ‚Äúwhy‚Äù can be the ticket to unlocking our potential and achieving greatness. It can be the driving force that gets us out of bed in the morning, pushing us to overcome obstacles and reach new heights. But what if we allowed ourselves to do things simply because we can? What if we acknowledged that some pursuits are driven not by a grandiose purpose, but by the sheer joy of existence?\n\nI‚Äôve come to realize that not every endeavor requires an elaborate purpose statement. Sometimes, the very act of doing something is reason enough. The world is a vast, intricate tapestry of knowledge and experiences, each thread interwoven with the next. And in the grand scheme of things, isn‚Äôt that reason enough to engage with life‚Äôs offerings?\n\nI‚Äôve found solace in embracing the simplicity of doing things I love, for the sake of loving them. My passions have become the guiding lights that lead me through the labyrinth of existence. I‚Äôm drawn to storytelling, so I immerse myself in writing and the art of crafting narratives. The allure of music has me exploring the realms of music production and DJing, allowing me to express myself in ways beyond words. And my fascination with the intricacies of life itself fuels my studies in biology and my forays into research.\n\nRather than getting caught in the quagmire of dissecting the ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù I‚Äôve found liberation in allowing my heart‚Äôs desires to take the lead. Instead of engaging in philosophical battles that often yield no definitive answers, I‚Äôve chosen to follow the path that resonates with my soul.\n\nThe notion of needing to prove something has gradually lost its hold on me. The very fact that I‚Äôm here, existing in this vast universe, is a profound accomplishment in itself. It‚Äôs a reminder that I don‚Äôt need to attach grand justifications to every action. I can bask in the joy of being alive, allowing my existence to be its own testament.\n\nEmbracing who I am doesn‚Äôt clash with my desire to become a better version of myself. Growth doesn‚Äôt always have to be quantifiable; it can simply manifest in the expansion of our experiences, the deepening of our passions, and the connections we forge along the way.\n\nIn my journey, I‚Äôve learned to trust my curiosity, to follow the threads of interest wherever they may lead. I‚Äôve relinquished the need for rigid purpose and instead found solace in the fluidity of my passions. The pursuit of happiness, knowledge, and joy doesn‚Äôt always require a meticulously crafted ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù Sometimes, it‚Äôs enough to revel in the present moment, to let our hearts sing the melodies of life without demanding an explanation.\n\nSo, let‚Äôs challenge the notion that every action must have a profound reason behind it. Let‚Äôs allow ourselves the freedom to engage with life in ways that light up our souls. After all, in the grand tapestry of existence, our uniqueness and our pursuit of happiness are reasons enough. And as we navigate this intricate journey, let‚Äôs do so with open hearts, trusting that our passions will guide us to places we never imagined possible.","lastmodified":"2023-11-09T01:51:08.06700141Z","tags":[]},"/private/drafts/draft-mindsets-to-bring-into-new-position-as-ugrad-research-assistant":{"title":"draft-mindsets to bring into new position as ugrad research assistant","content":"sldkjfsdl\n\n---\ninspo: \n- https://vanslearninglab.substack.com/p/mindsets-for-a-new-internship?utm_source=profile\u0026utm_medium=reader2 \n- ","lastmodified":"2023-11-09T01:51:08.06700141Z","tags":[]},"/private/drafts/draft-the-cards-ive-been-dealt":{"title":"draft-the cards i've been dealt","content":"title: the cards I've been dealt\nsubtitle: on resilience.\n\nDear friends, \nIf my life was a deck of cards, each card representing a distinct experience, I have a pretty good hand. I feel incredibly [[Man, I'm lucky|lucky]] - to have you all, to be in the Bay Area, and to have the amazing opportunity to learn from people I look up to at the Innovative Genomics Institute. \n\nAt the same time, I also have some pretty shitty cards, most of which represent something I don't feel comfortable writing about in public (yet) and consist of experiences that have left me feeling trapped, suffocated, and doubted. Formative experiences woven deep into my fabric of existence.\n\nTo undo these not-so-great cards I've been dealt, I've learned the art of reshuffling my deck. \n\nI had a self-help book phase. \n\nSometimes I wonder if diving head first into work is just a way for me to ignore having to confront the aftermath of those shitty cards. \n\n\nPoker metaphor - take a gamble\nBreaking out of my cage comes with consequences, though. But as I've gotten older and understood the costs of my actions, I've decided I'd rather have a go at it and deal with the ugly, ugly consequences than not live at all. \n\nDealing with the consequences gets easier, or so I thought. But they accumulate, and can be a lot to take in sometimes.\n\nI had a self-help book phase, and I have a self-defined purpose I work toward. I have fulfilling hobbies. My deck now holds cards filled with fulfilling hobbies, the ability to find the silver lining in life's moments, and the practice of living with intention and meaning.\n\nPoker metaphor - life is a series of bets and raises. \n- a bit cliche\nLife is a series of bets, raises, and sometimes even bluffs.

Back again with that shitty deck I started out with.\nI can feel the lingering weight of these tough cards / my starting tough cards. \nI ask, \"why me? Why do I have to deal with this?\" \nIn my late night messages I send, teary-eyed, to V, trembling voice in audio messages to T, and frantic texts to E asking for help and advice - that feeling of desperation, of hopelessness. Feels like I'm back to square 1. \n\nBut, the game's not over. I know it won't be over until I stop trying.\n\nSince high school, \nI've been on a journey to build a new hand, a hand filled with confidence, aspiration, and hope.
