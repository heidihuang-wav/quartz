A present-focus helps you enjoy life, but a future-focus helps you stay disciplined.\n- Small actions change your self-identity. \n\t- My take: It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. For instance, you take the first step and start exercising, you convince yourself you are someone who exercises, which further encourages you to exercise the next day, and the day after that.\n## Saying no \n- Refuse almost everything. Do almost nothing. But the things you do, do them all the way\n\t- If you‚Äôre not feeling ‚ÄúHell yeah, that would be awesome!‚Äù about something, say no. It‚Äôs an easier decision.\n- Art is useless; it's just for me ‚Äî I'm playing music for its own sake and loving it.\n- Your first reaction is usually outdated\n\t- When you‚Äôre less impulsive and more deliberate like this, it can be a little inconvenient for other people, but that‚Äôs OK. Someone asks you a question. You don‚Äôt need to answer. You can say, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù and take your time to answer after thinking\n- Even the toughest of us have delicate motivation. When you notice that something is affecting your drive, find a way to adjust your environment, even if that‚Äôs a little inconvenient for others.\n- Personal change needs some space to happen (you can't say yes to everything)\n- Before you start something, think of the ways it could end. Sometimes the smart choice is to say no to the whole game. \n- The solitary socialite: I love people one-on-one\n- How to get out of a bad state of mind\n\t1. Ask myself what‚Äôs wrong in this very second. Am I in physical pain or danger? No. I‚Äôve got mental pain, but that‚Äôs just me imagining things or remembering things. None of it is real.\n\t2. Observe now. Act later. Avoid acting when feeling cloudy.\n\t3. Raise standards. Say no to anything less than great\n\t\t- Raising the bar not only gives me a huge feeling of self-worth but also empties my time. Empty time helps me think clearly, because there‚Äôs more time to process and reflect\n\t4. Focus on my goal\n\t5. Do all the necessary stuff\n\t\t- When everyday responsibilities are done, my mind is less distracted\n## Making things happen \n- The system is designed so anyone can keep up. If you‚Äôre more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects\n- \"Half of my effort wasn‚Äôt effort at all, but just unnecessary stress that made me feel like I was doing my best\"\n\t- Take it easy. Focus your efforts/energy/attention where they matter.\n- Silence is a great canvas for your thoughts\n\t- Be disconnected, focus, do deep work\n- Some people think they need expensive equipment to start a new hobby, certain clothes to look the part, or for everything to be just right. But resourceful people know they don‚Äôt.\n- Change your focus. Instead of comparing up to the next higher situation, compare down to the next-lower one.\n- You need to be more grateful for what you‚Äôve got, for how much worse it could have been, and how nice it is to have anything at all. Ambition versus gratitude. Comparing up versus comparing down\n- Do you have a list of conditions you need to have met before you do something? Try changing the requirements (A *and* B) from and to \"or.\"\n\t- Reduce the activation energy required for you to take action\n- There are always more than two options. Open your mind to them.\n- Early in your career, the best strategy is to say yes to everything. The more things you try, and the more people you meet, the better. Each one might lead to your lucky break. Then when something is extra-rewarding, it‚Äôs time to switch strategies. Focus all of your energy on this one thing.\n- Think long-term; don't be paralyzed by the abundance of options\n- Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years\n## Changing Perspective\n- To assume you‚Äôre below average is to admit you‚Äôre still learning. You focus on what you need to improve\n- Embrace radical responsibility\n\t- Now you‚Äôre the person who made things happen, made a mistake, and can learn from it. Now you‚Äôre in control and there‚Äôs nothing to complain about.\n- I like to think that everything is a coincidence. Life feels more amazing to me if it has no meaning. No secret agenda. Beautifully random. \n\t- üòå\n- The excitement was in finding them, not keeping them \n\t- [[Quotes#Gottfried Ephraim Lessing|reminds me of this quote]]\n- Â°ûÁøÅÂ§±È¶¨ÔºõÁÑâÁü•ÈùûÁ¶è\n## What's Worth Doing?\n- We‚Äôre clearly bad judges of our creations. We should just put them out there and let the world decide. Are you holding back something that seems too obvious to share?\n- Three things to consider when making life-size decisions\n\t1. What makes you happy\n\t2. What‚Äôs smart ‚Äî meaning long-term good for you\n\t3. What‚Äôs useful to others\n- Don‚Äôt expect your job to fulfill all your emotional needs. Don‚Äôt taint something you love with the need to make money from it. Don‚Äôt try to make your job your whole life. Don‚Äôt try to make your art your sole income. Let each be what it is, and put in the extra effort to balance the two\n- When picking a job \n\t- Be smart, and choose something that pays well with a solid future\n\t- Inversion: what do you hate *not* doing?\n- When starting a business\n\t- Prove a real demand\n\t- Don‚Äôt announce anything. Don‚Äôt choose a name. Don‚Äôt make a website or an app. Don‚Äôt build a system. You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea.\n## Fixing faulty thinking \n- Deliberate unlearning:\n\t1. Doubt what I know. \n\t2. Stop the habit of thinking I know it. \n\t3. Require current proof that it‚Äôs still true today. Otherwise, let it go.\n- Most successful people I know have a narrow focus, protect themselves against time-wasters, say no to almost everything, and have let go of old limiting beliefs.\n- Look instead at what to remove.\n- Smart people don't think others are stupid: being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions\n- What matters is what I get out of their work, not the person who made it.\n- We think the differences between our group and another group are greater than they are.\n- To get smarter, you need to get surprised, think in new ways, and deeply understand different perspectives.\n- To make a change, you have to be extreme. Go all the way in the other direction.\n- Nothing has inherent meaning. We just choose to project meaning onto things.\n\t- tbh freeing in a sense\n## Saying yes\n- It‚Äôs overwhelming to feel so in awe of the people who seem to do it naturally. I‚Äôm just a beginner. It may take me another fifteen years, but I‚Äôm determined.\n- **Judge a goal by how well it changes your actions in the present moment.**\n- Inspiration\n\t- Nothing is truly inspiring unless you apply it to your work. (‚Äúwork‚Äù meaning your life‚Äôs output, whether creative, business, or personal). In other words, your work, itself, is the inspiration.\n\t- Inspiration is not receiving information. Inspiration is applying what you‚Äôve received.\n\t- For every bit of inspiration you take in, use it and amplify it by applying it to your work.\n- You grow by doing what scares you.\n\t- Notice what excites you and what scares you on a small moment-to-moment level.\n\t- Whatever scares you, go do it.","lastmodified":"2023-07-17T17:37:38.039963603Z","tags":["BookNotes","Self-help"]},"/Diary/Birth-of-this-Microblog":{"title":"Birth of this Microblog","content":"\nDunno what I'm doing but this is cool :) and makes me very happy!\n\nTook me way too long to realize the reason this wasn't working was because I don't know how to read instructions lol.

Would my professional pursuits be the same? \n\nI hesitated before answering yes to this question, which alarmed me. After thinking about this, I recognize the reason for my hesitation is my impatience. \n- The alternative: software, tech startups.\n- The question: so, why not software?\n\t- My primary interest lies in healthcare and the life sciences. This has been true for as long as I can remember.  \n\n\u003e [!faq]- Revision: ~~I also know there is exactly a ***0% chance*** I will be exceptional in the area if I go for software. Chances are still extremely slim with molecular therapeutics, but it's not 0.~~\n\u003e \n\u003e I will never let my self-perceived chances at being \"exceptional\" at something stop me from pursuing it because, to me, that goal seems a bit too black-and-white. I thought more about this statement after it was challenged. Instead of thinking about things this way, potentially perpetuating negative self-fulfilling prophecies, I'll just focus on doing the [[Diary/Focus \u0026 Hell Yeah or No|\"hell yeahs\"]], the things that are exciting and worth pursuing to me. Whether I have a shot at being \"exceptional\" at it or not is secondary‚ÄîI'll let the world decide that for me and allow outcomes, whatever they are, to unfold naturally.\n\u003e \n\u003e Thank you, TF, for challenging this notion.\n\u003e \n\u003e üõë I've dedicated considerable thought to my purpose and motivations (\"why\"), whether the field I've chosen is right for me (\"what\"), and other questions about the essence of my work. Given that I feel pretty solid about my answers to those questions for now, it's time to stop doing that for a little bit. For the next year or two, I believe it'll be more productive to direct my time and energy towards doing that work, rather than pondering and writing extensively about its nature.\n\n\n- The bottom line: I want to help build something to help people.
