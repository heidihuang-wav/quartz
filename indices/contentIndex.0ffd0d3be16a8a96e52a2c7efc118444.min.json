As long as caffeine consumption is controlled, and the association isn't exclusive, everything should be fine.\n\n## \"Hell Yeah or No\" by Derek Sivers\nStarted reading today. Short (~130 pages maybe) read.\n\nBook is high in value per word. \n\n### Highlights so far from Part 1 / 3 of the book: \"Updating Identity\"\n- Choose the local vs. global balance that works for you (being useful to your immediate, local community vs. the world).\n- Your *actions* show you what you actually want. React to this in 2 ways:\n\t1. Stop lying to yourself and admit your real priorities\n\t2. Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it's really true\n- Success comes from *doing*, not declaring.\n- Speak in the present tense only about what you're actually currently doing. Let go of past identities.\n- Whatever you decide, optimize for that goal, and be willing to *let go* of the others\n\t- My take: if you have more than X (X == 2, 3, idk) priorities, then none of them are priorities at all. 'cause ya simply can't focus on everything all at once\n- If you expect criticism in advance and take pride in your stance (however unusual it may be), you can bash on with a smile, being who you want to be.\n- Look around at existing ideas in the world. You can imitate them and still offer something unique.\n- Old opinions shouldn't define who we are in the future. Because they can change at any moment due to whatever experiences you go through.\n- Public comments are just feedback on something you made; they are not a reflection of who you are as a person.\n- Character is a result of your little choices and little actions. How you do anything is how you do everything.\n- Both a present-focused future-focused mindsets are necessary. A present-focus helps you enjoy life, but a future-focus helps you stay disciplined.\n- Small actions change your self-identity. \n\t- My take: It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. For instance, you take the first step and start exercising, you convince yourself you are someone who exercises, which further encourages you to exercise the next day, and the day after that.","lastmodified":"2023-07-16T16:46:08.820774157Z","tags":[]},"/Diary/Serendipity-file-management-health":{"title":"Serendipity, file management, health","content":"## Serendipity and math\n$Luck = f(A, E) = f(D, S, E)$\n\nLuck is a function of \n- $A$ - Surface Area.\n- $E$ - External Factors.

Would my professional pursuits be the same? \n\nI hesitated before answering yes to this question, which alarmed me. After thinking about this, I recognize the reason for my hesitation is my impatience. \n- The alternative: software, tech startups.\n- The question: so, why not software?\n\t- My primary interest lies in healthcare and the life sciences. This has been true for as long as I can remember.  \n\n\u003e [!faq]- Revision: ~~I also know there is exactly a ***0% chance*** I will be exceptional in the area if I go for software. Chances are still extremely slim with molecular therapeutics, but it's not 0.~~\n\u003e \n\u003e I will never let my self-perceived chances at being \"exceptional\" at something stop me from pursuing it because, to me, that goal seems a bit too black-and-white. I thought more about this statement after it was challenged. Instead of thinking about things this way, potentially perpetuating negative self-fulfilling prophecies, I'll just focus on doing the [[Diary/Focus \u0026 Hell Yeah or No|\"hell yeahs\"]], the things that are exciting and worth pursuing to me. Whether I have a shot at being \"exceptional\" at it or not is secondary‚ÄîI'll let the world decide that for me and allow outcomes, whatever they are, to unfold naturally.\n\u003e \n\u003e Thank you, TF, for challenging this notion.\n\u003e \n\u003e üõë I've dedicated considerable thought to my purpose and motivations (\"why\"), whether the field I've chosen is right for me (\"what\"), and other questions about the essence of my work. Given that I feel pretty solid about my answers to those questions for now, it's time to stop doing that for a little bit. For the next year or two, I believe it'll be more productive to direct my time and energy towards doing that work, rather than pondering and writing extensively about its nature.\n\n^3ace81\n\n- The bottom line: I want to help build something to help people. Ideally, to help improve health outcomes.\n- Source of my frustration: biotech seems to be much more regulated and slow-moving compared to software/tech startups\n- What I want to do: biotech\n- What I'm on the path to doing (and what matters most at the end of the day): biotech \n\t- cool, what I want to do and what I'm on the path to doing align. that's all i need to know.\n\n\u003e [!info] Reminder to self:\n\u003e don't lose sight of what really drives you. it's easy to be distracted by shiny things that seem to promise fast(er) results. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-16T16:46:08.820774157Z","tags":["Diary"]},"/Diary/What-the-heck-is-CRISPR":{"title":"What the heck is CRISPR?","content":"## Foreword\nInspired by [[Diary/Statistics \u0026 personal projects#^3ace81|recent reflections]], I've realized I *can* learn about molecular biology on my own outside the lab (duh lol). \n\nI say I study Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) and Public Health at UC Berkeley, so it's time to act like it.
