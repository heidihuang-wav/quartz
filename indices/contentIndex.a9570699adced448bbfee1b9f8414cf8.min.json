Would my professional pursuits be the same? \n\nI hesitated before answering yes to this question, which alarmed me. After thinking about this, I recognize the reason for my hesitation is my impatience. \n- The alternative: software, tech startups.\n- The question: so, why not software?\n\t- My primary interest lies in healthcare and the life sciences. This has been true for as long as I can remember. \n\t- I also know there is exactly a ***0% chance*** I will be exceptional in the area if I go for software. Chances are still extremely slim with molecular therapeutics, but it's not 0.\n- The bottom line: I want to help build something to help people. Ideally, to help improve health outcomes.\n- Source of my frustration: biotech seems to be much more regulated and slow-moving compared to software/tech startups\n- What I want to do: biotech\n- What I'm on the path to doing (and what matters most at the end of the day): biotech \n\t- cool, what I want to do and what I'm on the path to doing align. that's all i need to know.\n\n\u003e [!info] Reminder to self:\n\u003e don't lose sight of what really drives you. it's easy to be distracted by shiny things that seem to promise fast(er) results.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-12T14:22:26.773729618Z","tags":["DailyNotes"]},"/Quotes":{"title":"Quotes","content":"\n### Gottfried Ephraim Lessing\n\u003e If God were to hold all Truth concealed in his right hand, and in his left only the steady and diligent drive for Truth, albeit with the proviso that I would always and forever err in the process, and to offer me the choice, I would with all humility take the left hand.\n\n### 徐志摩 \n\u003e 得知，我幸；不得，我命\n\n### Young Sheldon\n\u003e Rabbi Schneiderman: Sheldon, when your days are over, God will never ask you, 'Why weren't you Einstein?' But he might ask you, 'Why weren't you Sheldon?'\n\n### How love should be / 出自安妮寶貝的《薔薇島嶼》\n\u003e 最好的愛情是兩個人彼此做伴。不要束縛，不要纏繞，不要佔有，不要渴望從對方身上挖掘到意義，那是註定要落空的。而應該是，我們兩個人，並排站在一起，看看這個落寞的人間。我愛你，不是因為你隨時隨地都能陪我，也不是你看起來像我的影子，你是你，我是我，我們兩個人是不同的兩個個體，我們珍惜在一起的每一個時刻，也尊重每一分冷暖自知的獨立狀態。\n\n### *Flow* by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n\u003e \"Attention can be invested in innumerable ways, ways that can make life either rich or miserable.\"\n\n\u003e “This sense of humility—the recognition that one’s goals may have to be subordinated to a greater entity, and that to succeed one may have to play by a different set of rules from what one would prefer—is a hallmark of strong people”\n\n\u003e “It is one thing to recognize that life is, by itself, meaningless.
