Let's find out.\n\n### The Role of Neurotransmitters\n- Dopamine: Steroids and PEDs can lead to increased dopamine levels in the brain.\n    - Elevated dopamine can induce feelings of euphoria and reward, contributing to enhanced motivation and focus during training and competition.\n    - The \"dopaminergic reward pathway\" may lead to the reinforcing effects of these substances, potentially leading to abuse.\n- Serotonin: Prolonged steroid use may decrease serotonin levels.\n    - Reduced serotonin is associated with mood swings, aggression, and impaired decision-making, commonly observed in some athletes abusing these substances.\n    - The altered serotonin function might contribute to a heightened risk of impulsive and aggressive behaviors.\n\n### The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis\n- Steroids and PEDs can disrupt the HPA axis, affecting the body's stress response system.\n    - Chronic exposure to these substances may suppress the production of cortisol, leading to an increased risk of injuries as cortisol helps regulate inflammation and immune response.\n    - Dysregulation of the HPA axis can also lead to mood disorders and adrenal insufficiency when the body becomes reliant on external steroid sources.\n\n### The Limbic System and Emotions\n- The limbic system is responsible for processing emotions and aggression.\n    - Steroid use may hyperactivate the amygdala, leading to increased aggression and irritability.\n    - The influence of steroids and PEDs on neurotransmitters can lead to significant mood and behavioral changes. Increased aggression and irritability, commonly referred to as \"roid rage,\" may occur due to altered serotonin and GABA receptor activity.\n\n### Cognitive Function and Memory\n- Chronic steroid use may affect cognitive function and memory.\n    - Some studies suggest that long-term use of steroids may impair working memory, attention, and executive functions.\n    - These cognitive deficits could impact an athlete's ability to strategize and make quick decisions during sports events.\n\n### The Reward System and Addiction\n- Steroids/PEDs can activate the brain's reward system, leading to potential addiction-like behaviors.\n    - Athletes may develop a psychological dependence on these substances due to their performance-enhancing effects and rewarding sensations.\n    - Addiction can have severe consequences, leading to adverse health effects and a decline in athletic performance.\n\n### Neuroplasticity and Long-term Changes\n- Chronic use of steroids/PEDs can alter brain neuroplasticity.\n    - Long-term exposure may lead to changes in neuronal connections and neural networks.\n    - These changes may persist even after discontinuing the substances, impacting an athlete's mental and physical health in the long run.","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T19:00:50.009380068Z","tags":["Biology"]},"/Book-List":{"title":"Book List","content":"## What This Is:\nA master list of books\n- I've read\n- I'm currently reading\n- and plan to read in the future\n\nLinked pages contain raw notes only.

React to this in 2 ways:\n\t1. Stop lying to yourself and admit your real priorities\n\t2. Start doing what you say you want to do, and see if it's really true\n- Success comes from *doing*, not declaring.\n- Speak in the present tense only about what you're actually currently doing. Let go of past identities.\n- Whatever you decide, optimize for that goal, and be willing to *let go* of the others\n\t- My take: if you have more than X (X == 2, 3, idk) priorities, then none of them are priorities at all. 'cause ya simply can't focus on everything all at once\n- If you expect criticism in advance and take pride in your stance (however unusual it may be), you can bash on with a smile, being who you want to be.\n- Look around at existing ideas in the world. You can imitate them and still offer something unique.\n- Old opinions shouldn't define who we are in the future. Because they can change at any moment due to whatever experiences you go through.\n- Public comments are just feedback on something you made; they are not a reflection of who you are as a person.\n- Character is a result of your little choices and little actions. How you do anything is how you do everything.\n- Both a present-focused future-focused mindsets are necessary. A present-focus helps you enjoy life, but a future-focus helps you stay disciplined.\n- Small actions change your self-identity. \n\t- My take: It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. For instance, you take the first step and start exercising, you convince yourself you are someone who exercises, which further encourages you to exercise the next day, and the day after that.\n## Saying no \n- Refuse almost everything. Do almost nothing. But the things you do, do them all the way\n\t- If you’re not feeling “Hell yeah, that would be awesome!” about something, say no. It’s an easier decision.\n- Art is useless; it's just for me — I'm playing music for its own sake and loving it.\n- Your first reaction is usually outdated\n\t- When you’re less impulsive and more deliberate like this, it can be a little inconvenient for other people, but that’s OK. Someone asks you a question. You don’t need to answer. You can say, “I don’t know,” and take your time to answer after thinking\n- Even the toughest of us have delicate motivation. When you notice that something is affecting your drive, find a way to adjust your environment, even if that’s a little inconvenient for others.\n- Personal change needs some space to happen (you can't say yes to everything)\n- Before you start something, think of the ways it could end. Sometimes the smart choice is to say no to the whole game. \n- The solitary socialite: I love people one-on-one\n- How to get out of a bad state of mind\n\t1. Ask myself what’s wrong in this very second. Am I in physical pain or danger? No. I’ve got mental pain, but that’s just me imagining things or remembering things. None of it is real.\n\t2. Observe now. Act later. Avoid acting when feeling cloudy.\n\t3. Raise standards. Say no to anything less than great\n\t\t- Raising the bar not only gives me a huge feeling of self-worth but also empties my time. Empty time helps me think clearly, because there’s more time to process and reflect\n\t4. Focus on my goal\n\t5. Do all the necessary stuff\n\t\t- When everyday responsibilities are done, my mind is less distracted\n## Making things happen \n- The system is designed so anyone can keep up. If you’re more driven than most people, you can do way more than anyone expects\n- \"Half of my effort wasn’t effort at all, but just unnecessary stress that made me feel like I was doing my best\"\n\t- Take it easy. Focus your efforts/energy/attention where they matter.\n- Silence is a great canvas for your thoughts\n\t- Be disconnected, focus, do deep work\n- Some people think they need expensive equipment to start a new hobby, certain clothes to look the part, or for everything to be just right. But resourceful people know they don’t.\n- Change your focus. Instead of comparing up to the next higher situation, compare down to the next-lower one.\n- You need to be more grateful for what you’ve got, for how much worse it could have been, and how nice it is to have anything at all. Ambition versus gratitude. Comparing up versus comparing down\n- Do you have a list of conditions you need to have met before you do something? Try changing the requirements (A *and* B) from and to \"or.\"\n\t- Reduce the activation energy required for you to take action\n- There are always more than two options. Open your mind to them.\n- Early in your career, the best strategy is to say yes to everything. The more things you try, and the more people you meet, the better. Each one might lead to your lucky break. Then when something is extra-rewarding, it’s time to switch strategies. Focus all of your energy on this one thing.\n- Think long-term; don't be paralyzed by the abundance of options\n- Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years\n## Changing Perspective\n- To assume you’re below average is to admit you’re still learning. You focus on what you need to improve\n- Embrace radical responsibility\n\t- Now you’re the person who made things happen, made a mistake, and can learn from it. Now you’re in control and there’s nothing to complain about.\n- I like to think that everything is a coincidence. Life feels more amazing to me if it has no meaning. No secret agenda. Beautifully random. \n\t- 😌\n- The excitement was in finding them, not keeping them \n\t- [[Quotes#Gottfried Ephraim Lessing|reminds me of this quote]]\n- 塞翁失馬；焉知非福\n## What's Worth Doing?\n- We’re clearly bad judges of our creations. We should just put them out there and let the world decide. Are you holding back something that seems too obvious to share?\n- Three things to consider when making life-size decisions\n\t1. What makes you happy\n\t2. What’s smart — meaning long-term good for you\n\t3. What’s useful to others\n- Don’t expect your job to fulfill all your emotional needs. Don’t taint something you love with the need to make money from it. Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income. Let each be what it is, and put in the extra effort to balance the two\n- When picking a job \n\t- Be smart, and choose something that pays well with a solid future\n\t- Inversion: what do you hate *not* doing?\n- When starting a business\n\t- Prove a real demand\n\t- Don’t announce anything. Don’t choose a name. Don’t make a website or an app. Don’t build a system. You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea.\n## Fixing faulty thinking \n- Deliberate unlearning:\n\t1. Doubt what I know. \n\t2. Stop the habit of thinking I know it. \n\t3. Require current proof that it’s still true today. Otherwise, let it go.\n- Most successful people I know have a narrow focus, protect themselves against time-wasters, say no to almost everything, and have let go of old limiting beliefs.\n- Look instead at what to remove.\n- Smart people don't think others are stupid: being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions\n- What matters is what I get out of their work, not the person who made it.\n- We think the differences between our group and another group are greater than they are.\n- To get smarter, you need to get surprised, think in new ways, and deeply understand different perspectives.\n- To make a change, you have to be extreme. Go all the way in the other direction.\n- Nothing has inherent meaning. We just choose to project meaning onto things.\n\t- tbh freeing in a sense\n## Saying yes\n- It’s overwhelming to feel so in awe of the people who seem to do it naturally. I’m just a beginner. It may take me another fifteen years, but I’m determined.\n- **Judge a goal by how well it changes your actions in the present moment.**\n- Inspiration\n\t- Nothing is truly inspiring unless you apply it to your work. (“work” meaning your life’s output, whether creative, business, or personal). In other words, your work, itself, is the inspiration.\n\t- Inspiration is not receiving information. Inspiration is applying what you’ve received.\n\t- For every bit of inspiration you take in, use it and amplify it by applying it to your work.\n- You grow by doing what scares you.\n\t- Notice what excites you and what scares you on a small moment-to-moment level.\n\t- Whatever scares you, go do it.","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T19:00:50.009380068Z","tags":["Book"]},"/Books/The-Land-of-Open-Graves":{"title":"The Land of Open Graves","content":"The US-Mexico border has long been a site of contested power, serving as a physical and symbolic boundary between two nations with vastly different economic and political systems. One of the most perilous areas along the border is the Sonoran Desert, which stretches from California to Mexico and is known for its harsh terrain and extreme temperatures. Unlike other more urban areas of entry, which offer some level of infrastructure, crossing the Sonoran Desert requires migrants to navigate remote areas with limited access to food, water, and medical care. For many migrants, the journey through the Sonoran Desert is a matter of life and death, with countless individuals perishing from dehydration, heat stroke, and other forms of trauma. In The Land of Open Graves, Jason de León delves into the complexity and violence of migration through the Sonoran Desert, highlighting the human toll of a border policy that seeks to render the experiences of undocumented migrants invisible. As the book’s central quotation states, “the Border Patrol disguises the impact of its current enforcement policy by mobilizing a combination of sterilized discourse, redirected blame, and ‘natural’ environmental processes that erase evidence of what happens in the most remote parts of southern Arizona. The goal is to render invisible the innumerable consequences this sociopolitical phenomenon has for the lives and bodies of undocumented people. Those who live and die in the desert have names, faces, and families. They also have complicated life histories that reflect an intimate relationship with transnational migration and global economic inequality.” (de León 2015, 4-5). Through employing a mixed-methods approach, drawing on fields such as forensics, anthropology, and archaeology, de León examines the complex forms of violence perpetrated by the hybrid collectif in the context of migration, shedding light on how this violence results in the death of migrants, the mistreatment of their bodies postmortem, and the broader implications of such violence, including the experience of ambiguous loss among family members and the impact on children left behind. \n\nDe León employs a semi-fictionalized ethnographic approach to illustrate the theme of violence and the harsh reality of border crossings as caused by Prevention Through Deterrence (PTD), a border enforcement strategy implemented by the US government based on the idea that making crossing more treacherous will discourage people from attempting to cross in the first place. Under this strategy, the government has implemented various tactics, such as increasing border security, fencing, and surveillance and funneling migrants toward the Sonoran Desert, a challenging terrain with extreme temperatures and limited access to resources necessary for survival. He bases the stories of “Lupe, Carlos, Marcos, and Javier” on hundreds of interviews with migrants over the years to combat the dehumanization and erasure of violence perpetuated by PTD (de León 2015, 59). By incorporating these semi-fictional stories, de León provides a human face to the otherwise faceless issue of border crossing, allowing readers to empathize with migrants and see them as individuals rather than statistics on a page. \n\nTo further expose the brutal reality of PTD and its effects on the lives of real people, de León draws on methods from contemporary archaeology to gain insight into migrants’ intentions, experiences, and physical suffering they endured during their journey. For example, De León finds a pair of worn-out shoes whose “sole has been separated from the upper” and has been repaired by a “bra strap” (de León 2015, 181). This modification indicates the shoe owner’s desperation to keep moving despite worn-out footwear, highlighting the harsh reality of the environmental conditions migrants must endure, such as blistered feet, as they walk for miles through difficult terrain. De León's use of contemporary archaeology also provides insight into the economic and social factors driving migration. By examining objects left behind, such as “black and camouflage” backpacks, clothing, and water bottles, he can understand the strategies migrants use to carry personal belongings and other necessities to face (de León 2015, 160). While these strategies highlight migrants’ resourcefulness and resilience in the face of the Sonoran desert's challenges, they also underscore the violence inherent in US immigration policy that pushes migrants to undertake dangerous journeys and how the desert, intersecting with human actants, shape the experiences and outcomes of migration. ChatGPT indeed corroborates the role of the Sonoran Desert’s “harsh and unforgiving landscape” in deterring migrants from crossing the border, but it mistakenly describes “canines” as the “most prominent” example of nonhuman agency in de León’s book. Canines do consume human flesh and contribute to destroying migrants’ bodies, but they are not the main focus of the author’s discussion surrounding nonhuman forces which act as agents of deterrence and violence.\n\nThe violence inflicted upon migrants by the hybrid collectif does not stop at death, however. In fact, de León captures continued violence postmortem, a phenomenon also known as necroviolence, through the use of experimentation with pig carcasses, explicit photos, and in-depth analyses of violent practices. To recreate the necroviolence that occurs at the US-Mexico border, de León conducts experiments with pig carcasses to understand how the environment and the hybrid collectif contribute to the postmortem violence inflicted upon migrant bodies. Observing what happens to a pig carcass days after death—“ripped apart...devoured by vultures…\\[and] scattered to the wind”—the author finds that the harsh environmental conditions allow for the desecration of migrant bodies, which become unidentifiable and sometimes destroyed altogether (de León 2015, 82). He supplements his text with images that vividly depict the destruction of pig carcasses in just a few days. These visuals, in addition to photos of border crossers’ left-behind personal belongings, provide concrete evidence of the necroviolence that takes place at the US-Mexico border. ChatGPT erroneously states that de León believes including “photographs of migrants' bodies and personal belongings \\[contributes] to their objectification and exploitation.” From the beginning, de León makes clear that “words alone could never capture the complexity, emotion, or realities of the violence, suffering, and victories” migrants experience (de León 2015, 18). Including images and faces is, therefore, the author’s attempt at humanizing undocumented migrants and the process of border crossing rather than an attempt to capitalize on graphic images for the sake of sensationalism. De León also takes great care to ensure that his research was conducted ethically and responsibly. Although he shows migrants' faces and uses real names for deceased members, he is sensitive to the potential harm that his research could cause to the migrants he studies and to the communities he works with, so he takes steps to protect the privacy and anonymity of his research subjects, using pseudonyms and changing identifying details to prevent their identification when necessary. ChatGPT’s statements align with this claim and confirm that “human values” and ethical considerations should be at the forefront of decision-making, even in the pursuit of academic or professional goals. \n\nAdditionally, the author argues that the state’s perception of the US-Mexico border as a “space of exception” contributes to the necropolitics of the border by creating a zone where the suspension of human and constitutional rights is justified in the name of national security (de León 2015, 68). As ChatGPT writes, these “‘necropolitical’ policies” lead to the “dehumanization and neglect of” both “living and dead” migrants. Indeed, the continued violence inflicted upon migrant bodies, even in death, is a potent reminder of the power dynamics at play in the hybrid collectif and the ways in which the Sonoran Desert and other environmental factors contribute to the state's exercise of power over migrant bodies.\n\nDe León's exploration of the hybrid collectif's violence extends beyond the migrants who attempt to cross the border, as it also affects their families and loved ones left behind. He recounts the story of Maricela, a migrant who died in the desert and suffered the aftermath of the hybrid collectif's brutality. The majority of Latin America's population is Catholic, and “viewing the body is a key element of mourning” (de León 2015, 253). Thus, the destruction of the corpse poses a significant threat for two religious reasons: first, the absence of the body rules out the possibility of holding a wake and building a grave for family members to visit and pray; second, a damaged or incomplete corpse is perceived as a threat to the afterlife since it may prevent people from rising from the dead for judgment. The hybrid collectif's violation of Catholic burial norms in the desert is \"symbolically potent, as an exceptional and avowedly demeaning act\" (de León 2015, 83). The nonhuman actant that is the Sonoran Desert plays a significant role in the hybrid collectif's violence towards migrants, as it not only deters them and brings about death but also inflicts further harm upon their families and religious beliefs.\n\nThe US-Mexico border, particularly the Sonoran Desert, serves as a site of contested power and violence, and The Land of Open Graves explores the human toll of migration through this harsh terrain. By using a mixed-methods approach, including semi-fictionalized ethnography and contemporary archaeology, de León illustrates the violence inherent in PTD and highlights the impact it has on the lives of real people. Furthermore, de León exposes the continued violence inflicted upon migrants postmortem, a phenomenon known as necroviolence, through experimentation with pig carcasses and in-depth analyses of violent practices. The Land of Open Graves provides a powerful and insightful examination of the experiences of undocumented migrants and the impact of US border policy, reminding readers of the human cost of the ongoing border crisis. By revealing the human consequences of the immigration security paradigm, de León's work highlights the urgent need for more humane and just policies to address the challenges facing migrants today.","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T19:00:50.009380068Z","tags":["Book"]},"/Diary/07-2023/Birth-of-this-Microblog":{"title":"Birth of this Microblog","content":"\nDunno what I'm doing but this is cool :) and makes me very happy!\n\nTook me way too long to realize the reason this wasn't working was because I don't know how to read instructions lol.

Let go of past identities.\n- Whatever you decide, optimize for that goal, and be willing to *let go* of the others\n\t- My take: if you have more than X (X == 2, 3, idk) priorities, then none of them are priorities at all. 'cause ya simply can't focus on everything all at once\n- If you expect criticism in advance and take pride in your stance (however unusual it may be), you can bash on with a smile, being who you want to be.\n- Look around at existing ideas in the world. You can imitate them and still offer something unique.\n- Old opinions shouldn't define who we are in the future. Because they can change at any moment due to whatever experiences you go through.\n- Public comments are just feedback on something you made; they are not a reflection of who you are as a person.\n- Character is a result of your little choices and little actions. How you do anything is how you do everything.\n- Both a present-focused future-focused mindsets are necessary. A present-focus helps you enjoy life, but a future-focus helps you stay disciplined.\n- Small actions change your self-identity. \n\t- My take: It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. For instance, you take the first step and start exercising, you convince yourself you are someone who exercises, which further encourages you to exercise the next day, and the day after that.","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T19:00:50.009380068Z","tags":["Diary","July2023"]},"/Diary/07-2023/July-2023":{"title":"July 2023","content":"## Posts (newest → oldest)\n- [[Biology/Biology Stuff|Biology Stuff]]\n\t- [[Biology/Your brain on steroids|Your brain on steroids]]\n\t- [[Biology/What the heck is CRISPR?]]\n- [[Diary/07-2023/Focus \u0026 Hell Yeah or No|Focus \u0026 Hell Yeah or No]]\n- [[Diary/07-2023/Statistics \u0026 personal projects|Statistics \u0026 personal projects]]\n- [[Diary/07-2023/Serendipity, file management, health|Serendipity, file management, health]]\n- [[Diary/07-2023/Birth of this Microblog|Birth of this Microblog]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T19:00:50.013380313Z","tags":[]},"/Diary/07-2023/Serendipity-file-management-health":{"title":"Serendipity, file management, health","content":"## Serendipity and math\n$Luck = f(A, E) = f(D, S, E)$\n\nLuck is a function of \n- $A$ - Surface Area.\n- $E$ - External Factors.

Would my professional pursuits be the same? \n\nI hesitated before answering yes to this question, which alarmed me. After thinking about this, I recognize the reason for my hesitation is my impatience. \n- The alternative: software, tech startups.\n- The question: so, why not software?\n\t- My primary interest lies in healthcare and the life sciences. This has been true for as long as I can remember.  \n\n\u003e [!faq]- Revision: ~~I also know there is exactly a ***0% chance*** I will be exceptional in the area if I go for software.

I thought more about this statement after it was challenged. Instead of thinking about things this way, potentially perpetuating negative self-fulfilling prophecies, I'll just focus on doing the [[Diary/07-2023/Focus \u0026 Hell Yeah or No|\"hell yeahs\"]], the things that are exciting and worth pursuing to me. Whether I have a shot at being \"exceptional\" at it or not is secondary—I'll let the world decide that for me and allow outcomes, whatever they are, to unfold naturally.\n\u003e \n\u003e Thank you, TF, for challenging this notion.\n\u003e \n\u003e 🛑 I've dedicated considerable thought to my purpose and motivations (\"why\"), whether the field I've chosen is right for me (\"what\"), and other questions about the essence of my work. Given that I feel pretty solid about my answers to those questions for now, it's time to stop doing that for a little bit. For the next year or two, I believe it'll be more productive to direct my time and energy towards doing that work, rather than pondering and writing extensively about its nature.\n\n\n- The bottom line: I want to help build something to help people. Ideally, to help improve health outcomes.\n- Source of my frustration: biotech seems to be much more regulated and slow-moving compared to software/tech startups\n- What I want to do: biotech\n- What I'm on the path to doing (and what matters most at the end of the day): biotech \n\t- cool, what I want to do and what I'm on the path to doing align. that's all i need to know.\n\n\u003e [!info] Reminder to self:\n\u003e don't lose sight of what really drives you. it's easy to be distracted by shiny things that seem to promise fast(er) results. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T19:00:50.013380313Z","tags":["Diary","July2023"]},"/Diary/08-2023/Bentoism":{"title":"Bentoism 🍱","content":"### What is Bentoism? \n\u003e [see for yourself!](https://bentoism.org/)\n- A multi-dimensional way of framing what you want\n\t- x-axis is time: from now -\u003e the future\n\t- y-axis interest: from self interest -\u003e collective interest\n- A tool for making decisions aligned with our values and goals. \n\n### My Bento\n![[Images/MyBentoDrawing.png]]\n### What does each quadrant mean? \nDirectly taken from [here](https://bentoism.org/2-the-bento-method#18)\n1. **Now Me**: is the most “selfish” part of you.

all Truth concealed in his right hand, and in his left only the steady and diligent drive for Truth, albeit with the proviso that I would always and forever err in the process, and to offer me the choice, I would with all humility take the left hand.\n\n## 徐志摩 \n\u003e 得知，我幸；不得，我命\n\n\n## Stewart Brand\n\u003e Fast learns, slow remembers.  Fast proposes, slow disposes.  Fast is discontinuous, slow is continuous.  Fast and small instructs slow and big by accrued innovation and by occasional revolution.  Slow and big controls small and fast by constraint and constancy.  _Fast gets all our attention, slow has all the power._\n\u003e\n\u003e [Source](https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/issue3-brand/release/2)\n\n## Sam Altman\n\u003e Have almost too much self-belief.\n\n## Young Sheldon\n\u003e Rabbi Schneiderman: Sheldon, when your days are over, God will never ask you, 'Why weren't you Einstein?' But he might ask you, 'Why weren't you Sheldon?'\n\n## How love should be / 出自安妮寶貝的《薔薇島嶼》\n\u003e 最好的愛情是兩個人彼此做伴。不要束縛，不要纏繞，不要佔有，不要渴望從對方身上挖掘到意義，那是註定要落空的。而應該是，我們兩個人，並排站在一起，看看這個落寞的人間。我愛你，不是因為你隨時隨地都能陪我，也不是你看起來像我的影子，你是你，我是我，我們兩個人是不同的兩個個體，我們珍惜在一起的每一個時刻，也尊重每一分冷暖自知的獨立狀態。\n\n## *Flow* by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\n\u003e \"Attention can be invested in innumerable ways, ways that can make life either rich or miserable.\"\n\n\u003e “This sense of humility—the recognition that one’s goals may have to be subordinated to a greater entity, and that to succeed one may have to play by a different set of rules from what one would prefer—is a hallmark of strong people”\n\n\u003e “It is one thing to recognize that life is, by itself, meaningless. It is another thing entirely to accept this resignation. The first fact does not entail the second any more than the fact that we lack wings prevents us from flying”\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-31T19:00:50.017380559Z","tags":["Quotes"]}}
