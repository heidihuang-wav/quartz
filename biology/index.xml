Summary The study demonstrates efficient genome editing in post-mitotic neurons of the adult mouse brain using Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes -&amp;gt; holds promise for correcting/inactivating genetic causes of neurological diseases characterized by specific neuronal populations via safe Cas9 delivery with minimal immune response Engineered Cas9 variants with multiple SV40 nuclear localization sequences (NLS) enhance the efficiency of neuronal genome editing in vivo by 10x, addressing the challenge of tissue-specific delivery Mouse model Ai9 tdTomato is used to detect Cas9 editing, providing a quantitative method for genome modification.</description></item><item><title>Flow Cytometry</title><link>https://heidihuang.com/Biology/Flow-Cytometry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://heidihuang.com/Biology/Flow-Cytometry/</guid><description>Helpful animated video Takeaways from video Flow cytometry is an experimental technique used to count and analyze individual cells within a mixed population based on their size, shape, and other properties.</description></item><item><title>Glossary</title><link>https://heidihuang.com/Biology/Glossary/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://heidihuang.com/Biology/Glossary/</guid><description> Lab techniques [[Biology/Flow Cytometry|Flow Cytometry]] [[Biology/Cell culture tips]]</description></item><item><title>In vivo CRISPR base editing of PCSK9 durably lowers cholesterol in primates</title><link>https://heidihuang.com/Biology/In-vivo-CRISPR-base-editing-of-PCSK9-durably-lowers-cholesterol-in-primates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://heidihuang.com/Biology/In-vivo-CRISPR-base-editing-of-PCSK9-durably-lowers-cholesterol-in-primates/</guid><description>Link to paper

Summary Distinct circuits for short and long timescale control Sequential negative feedback signals from the mouth and gut engage distinct circuits in the caudal brainstem, controlling feedback behavior on both short (PRLH) and long (GCG) timescales PRLH neurons respond to oral cues and control short-term feeding dynamics PRLH neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) exhibit sustained activation by visceral feedback during stomach nutrient infusion During oral consumption, PRLH neurons shift to a phasic activity pattern linked to the taste of food Optogenetic manipulations show that PRLH neurons regulate the duration of seconds-timescale feeding bursts GCG neurons respond to GI feedback for long-term satiety GCG neurons in the cNTS are activated by mechanical feedback from the gut and track the cumulative amount of food consumed.</description></item></channel></rss>
